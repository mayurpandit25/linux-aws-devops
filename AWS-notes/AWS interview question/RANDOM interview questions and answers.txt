=============================================================================================================================================================

4.In vpc with private and public subnets, database servers should ideally be launched into which subnet
--> database servers are launched in a private subnets because private subnets don't have the internet access so no other user can directly communicate with the database and if suppose we want to update database then we can use nat gateway 

=============================================================================================================================================================

---> 
1.aws load balancer distributes the incoming application load traffic across the multiple targets such as ec2 instances in a multiple az.
2.load balancer acts as a traffic cop sitting Infront of our servers and routing the clients requests across all the server capable of routing these requests.
3.it can also checks the health of the target and ensures that the traffic should be routed only to the healthy targets.
4.it has a three types
   1.application load balancer
      it distributes the incoming application load traffic accross multiple targets such as ec2 instances in a multiple az

   2.network load balancer

18.What is amazon s3 & explain the components of amazon s3
---> amazon s3 is simple storage service that store the any form of data any type of data and retrieve the data anytime, anywhere on the internet.

Bucket
1.a bucket is a container that stores upto 5TB of objects 
2.bucket names are global unique and its a region specific service

Object
1.a object is a actual data stored in the s3
2.obejct can be data, key or metadata

key
1.a key is a unique identifier for an object inside a bucket
2.it looks like a folder path but s3 is flat storage

versioning
1.versioning can be used for protecting the objects in the bucket.
2.and also the maintains the versions of each object

ACLs
 With acls we can define the permissions of the bucket like read, write and execute

lifecycle rules
1.with a lifecycle policy or can optimize the cost by moving the object into the most cost effective access tier
2.also used for deleting the old objects

replication
 Its a copy of the object stored in the another region for disaster recovery and low latency

encyption
  generally we used encryption to encrypt the data at rest and in transit

=======================================================================================================================================================================

19.what are the different types of cloud computing models

Terminating  
1.whenever the ec2 instance is terminated all the things should be gone
2.except the ebs root volume is detach if delete on termination is enabled
3.elastic ip is detach but not deleted.

=======================================================================================================================================================================

22.What the difference between the horizontal scaling and the vertical scaling
---> 

HORIZONTAL SCALING
1.if the bottleneck is cpu and memory then we can scale up and scale down the ec2 instances based on the demand
2.so it improves the high availability and fault tolerance


VERTICAL SCALING
1.if the bottleneck is resource specific then we can perform the vertical scaling means adding the resources on the existing instances
2.but usually requires the instance stopping and starting to change the instance type. 

=======================================================================================================================================================================

23.What is security groups and NACLs
---> 

Security Groups
1.security groups works like a virtual firewall works at ENI level

3.and its stateful means return traffic is automatically allowed

NACLs
1.it is network access control list that maintains the inbound as well as outbound traffic works on the subnet level
2.it can allow the rules as well the deny the rules also
3.its a stateless means return traffic is not automatically allowed

3.amazon s3 intelligent tiering 
   amazon s3 intelligent tiering is a storage that optimizes the cost by automatically moving the objects in the most cost effective access tier. It uses the two tier to switch the object i.e amazon s3 standard and amazon s3 infrequent access

4.amazon s3 one-zone access
   amazon s3 one-zone access is a storage which is less frequently accessible but requires rapid access when needed. Basically it provides only the one zone to store the objects.
