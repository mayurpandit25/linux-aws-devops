**AWS CLOUD MIGRATION STRATEGIS**

you have to plan some strategies first while you are going for the project

how did you migrate your application onto cloud

1.preparation
2.planning
3.migrate 
4.monitor
5.optimize/improve


**migration strategies**

1.rehost:-(lift and shift)
  1.it is basically lift and shift which is very simple and mostly companies used these approach
  2.lift and shift means if you 200 or more microservices on your on-premises cloud then the very minimalistic efforts or zero efforts you can easily the shift these 
    services on the aws cloud.
  3.in these approach we can also optimize the cost but only minimum.
       Advantages: Quick migration, minimal code changes, and lower upfront costs.
       Challenges: May not fully leverage cloud-native features, and potential missed optimization opportunities.

2.replatform:
  1.basically similar to the rehost(lift and shift) but in these we follow the best aws practices.or you will take the good features of aws and will try to implement 
    on your applications.

3.repurchase:-
   1.


4.refactor/rearchitecture:-
   1.let supppose you are using the monolithic application and these application should converted into many microservices so if u converting these into microservice 
     means that you can rearchitecture your application in latest or new update that provides the aws
        Advantages: Improved performance, scalability, and efficiency. Can take advantage of cloud-native features.
        Challenges: Requires more time and resources compared to rehosting. May involve significant code changes.

5.relocate:-
   1.it could refer to the broader concept of moving applications, data, or infrastructure from an on-premises environment to a cloud environment.



6.retire:-
   1.



7.retain:-
    1.Some applications or components may not be suitable for migration or may not provide significant benefits from the cloud environment. In such cases, 
      organizations may choose to retain them on-premises.
         Advantages: Minimal disruption, suitable for certain legacy applications.
         Challenges: May miss out on cloud benefits, scalability, and innovation
