Migration Strategies:-

1.What are the AWS Migration Strategies

Rehost (Lift and Shift)
Move apps to AWS with minimal or zero changes
Fastest method, widely used
Cost optimization possible but limited

Replatform
Similar to rehost but with AWS best practices
Example: Moving database to RDS, applying managed services

Repurchase
Move to a SaaS platform (e.g., old CRM → Salesforce)
Your notes mention but do not describe; we fill with standard definition.

Refactor / Rearchitect
Modify application architecture (e.g., monolith → microservices)
Enables cloud-native benefits and modernization
More cost, time, and complexity

Relocate
Move entire workloads without purchasing new hardware
Example: VMware → VMware Cloud on AWS

Retire
Remove applications that are not needed (legacy removal)

Retain
Keep some applications on-premises
Useful for apps that do not benefit from the cloud

Q2. What are the phases of migration?

Preparation
Planning
Migrate
Monitor
Optimize/Improve

================================================================================

Q3. How do companies select a migration strategy?

Business urgency
Application architecture complexity
Cost targets
Skill availability
Dependency mapping
RTO/RPO requirements
Long-term modernization goals

================================================================================

Q4. What AWS tools help in migration?

AWS Migration Hub
AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)
AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)
AWS Server Migration Service (SMS)
Cloud Endure Disaster Recovery
AWS Snowball / Snowmobile

================================================================================

Scenario 1: 

A company has 200 microservices on-prem and wants to migrate them quickly with minimal effort. Which strategy should be used?

Answer: Rehost (Lift and Shift)

“Lift and shift means minimal or zero effort. Very simple. Mostly companies use this approach.”

================================================================================

Scenario 2: 

Application works fine but the company wants to improve performance & cost by using managed services. Which strategy fits?

Answer: Replatform

1.Move MySQL on EC2 → Amazon RDS
2.Move application servers → Elastic Beanstalk

================================================================================

Scenario 3: 

You have a monolithic Java application and want to break it into microservices on AWS. What strategy is this?

Answer: Refactor / Rearchitect

“If monolithic → convert to microservices → you are rearchitecting.

================================================================================

Scenario 4: 

Your organization wants to move away from self-hosted CRM and start using Salesforce. What is this?

Answer: Repurchase

This means replacing the app with a SaaS solution.

================================================================================

Scenario 5: 

An old legacy app is barely used and expensive to maintain. What should you do?

Answer: Retire

Remove unnecessary workloads to reduce cost.

================================================================================

Scenario 6: 

Your company has a licensing issue and regulatory requirement, preventing migration of a specific on-prem app. Which strategy?

Answer: Retain

Keep workloads on-prem if migration offers no benefit.

================================================================================

Scenario 7: 

You want to move your entire VMware infrastructure to AWS with minimal modification.

Answer: Relocate

Example: VMware Cloud → AWS using VMC on AWS

================================================================================

Scenario 8: 

You want to migrate a database from on-prem to AWS with zero downtime. Which service should you choose?

Answer:
AWS Database Migration Service (DMS).
  Supports continuous replication
  Minimal downtime

================================================================================

Scenario 9: 

You need to migrate petabytes of data but WAN bandwidth is limited.

Solution:
Use AWS Snowball / Snowmobile.

================================================================================

Scenario 10: 

After a lift & shift, the application is working but costs are too high. What is the solution?

Answer:
Start “Optimization Phase”:
Right-size EC2 instances
Move to RDS / DynamoDB
Enable Auto Scaling
Use S3 lifecycle & intelligent tiering
Switch to serverless where possible

================================================================================

Scenario 11: 

A security audit requires monitoring cloud environment post-migration. What tools should be used?

Use:

CloudTrail (tracks API calls)
CloudWatch (monitoring)
GuardDuty (threat detection)
IAM Access Analyzer

================================================================================

Q1. Performance degraded after rehosting the application. Why?

Reasons:
Not sized correctly
Missing autoscaling
On-prem network assumptions not valid in cloud
EBS IOPS too low
DNS latency issues
No caching (CloudFront, Redis)

Q2. Application fails in replatforming step. Why?

Possible issues:
Incompatible DB engine versions
Hard-coded IPs in application
Incorrect IAM roles
Misconfigured security groups

Q3. Microservices converted from monolith are failing.

Common causes:
Wrong decoupling
No service discovery
High inter-service latency
Missing CI/CD pipelines
Wrong API Gateway mapping

Q4. Database migration results in data mismatch.

Troubleshooting:
Re-run full load
Validate CDC (change data capture) setup
Compare table schemas
Check collation / encoding differences
