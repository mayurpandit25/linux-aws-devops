SCENARIO-BASED QUESTIONS- ROUTE 53

***************************************************************************************************

1. Scenario:

You registered a domain using a third-party registrar. After connecting it to Route 53, the website is still not resolving even after 2 hours.
Question: What is the most likely reason for the delay?

Answer:
DNS changes, especially name server updates, can take up to 48 hours due to global DNS caching (TTL).

***************************************************************************************************

2. Scenario:

You want Route 53 to route traffic away from a malfunctioning web server and switch to a backup server.
Question: Which routing policy would you use?

Answer:
Use Failover Routing Policy, which routes traffic to the primary as long as it is healthy, and switches to secondary when unhealthy. 

***************************************************************************************************

3. Scenario:

Your application is deployed in both Mumbai and N. Virginia regions. Users from London should be routed automatically to the region with lowest latency.
Question: Which routing policy applies?

Answer:
Latency-Based Routing, which routes users to the region providing the lowest latency.

***************************************************************************************************

4. Scenario:

You want to show different localized content for users in Asia vs Europe.
Question: Which routing policy should be used?

Answer:
Geolocation Routing, which routes based on the origin of DNS queries (continent, country, or US state).

***************************************************************************************************

5. Scenario:

You need to route 20% traffic to a new version of application and 80% to the stable version.
Question: Which routing policy helps?

Answer:
Weighted Routing, allowing weights like 1 (20%) and 4 (80%).

***************************************************************************************************

6. Scenario:

You want to shift some percentage of global traffic from Europe servers to US servers.
Question: Which policy allows shifting traffic using “BIAS”?

Answer:
Geo-Proximity Routing, which uses “BIAS” to expand or shrink geographic traffic regions. 

***************************************************************************************************

7. Scenario:

A web server is configured as an S3 static website. You want failover between S3 bucket and EC2 instance.
Question: Is it possible?

Answer:
Yes. Failover routing supports routing traffic between any type of resource, including S3 static website and EC2. 

***************************************************************************************************

8. What records does Route 53 create automatically in a hosted zone?

NS (name server) and SOA records

***************************************************************************************************

9. What is the limit of hosted zones and record sets in Route 53?

500 hosted zones and 10,000 records per zone (can be increased).

***************************************************************************************************

10. When does TTL matter during DNS migration?

During name server updates, as DNS changes may take up to 48 hours.

***************************************************************************************************

11. How does Geolocation Routing decide priority?

Smaller geographic area takes priority (e.g., Canada over North America).

***************************************************************************************************

12. What is the purpose of Weighted Routing?

Load balancing or testing new versions by defining traffic proportions.

***************************************************************************************************

13. What is the purpose of NS record?

Identifies which name servers are authoritative for the zone.
