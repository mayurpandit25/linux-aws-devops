**Lab on nat getway:-

1.create a vpc-----10.0.0.0/18

2.create a subnet
    public subnet----10.0.0.0/20
    private subnet---10.0.16.0/20

3.create a internet getway and attach to vpc

4.create a nat getway

5.create a route table
    public route-----give the public subnet and giving the internet getway
    private route----give the private subnet and giving the nat getway

6.then go to ec2
    1.create a private instance by giving them a private subnet
    2.create a bastion host server by giving them a public subnet

7.then access the bastion host server 
    1.save the pem key
    2.give the ssh to access the private instance
    3.then access the private instance by ssh
      (ssh -i (pem-key name) (machine name)@(private IP of private instance)
    4.then ping 8.8.8.8 to check the internet and its working.
