**Lab on nat instance

1.create a vpc---10.0.0.0/16
2.create a subnet
    public subnet----10.0.0.0/24
    private subnet---10.0.1.0/24
3.create a internet getway and attach to a vpc
4.create a route table
    public route---add a public subnet and give the internet getway
5.then go to ec2
    1.launch a instance 
    2.search a nat and click on community AMi and select a nat instance
    3.give the vpc and public subnet to route the internet for private instance
    4.giving the security group and add the ssh,http,and all ICMP v4.
    5.then launch the instance
6.then create a private instance
    1.take the amazon machine
    2.select vpc and give the private subnet
    3.attach a security group
    4.launch the instance
7.then access the nat instance
    1.access nat instance
    2.save the pem key
    3.check also internet is working or nat
    4.then give the ssh so that we can access private instance on nat instance
8.then access private instance
    1.check internet is by ping 8.8.8.8 and the internet is not working
    2.so go to the route table and when we create a nat instance that time the default route for nat is automatically 
      created.
    3.so click on the route table and click on route and give the nat instance
    4.then check the internet by ping 8.8.8.8 and the internet is not working
    5.then go to ec2 and click on the nat instance then click on action then click on networking then click on 
      check source/destination check and stop the checking and then save
    6.and then you can check the internet by ping 8.8.8.8 and you can access the internet.
