**Lab on network ACL

 1.create a vpc-------10.0.0.0/16

 2.create a subnet
       public subnet---10.0.0.0/24

 3.create a internet getway and attach to a vpc

 4.create a route table 
       public route---add subnet association and route on these

 5.creat a network acl
      1.associate a subnet
      2.add inbound permission 
            100---ssh 
      3.add outbound permission 
            100---http 
            200---https
 
 6.then create a ec2 server and access these you can not access the server because of the permission you give in only 
   inbound traffic.you have to give the permission on the outbound also so that you can access the permission
      1.outbound traffic---250--all tcp--1024-65535

 7.then you can access these ec2 server
 
 8.then try to access the internet you cant access the internet because you have only allow outbound traffic so we can also
   add permission on the inbound traffic.
      1.inbound traffic----200---all tcp---1024-65535
