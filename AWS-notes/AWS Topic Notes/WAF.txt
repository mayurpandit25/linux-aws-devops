WAF ====>>> web application firewall

*******************************************************************************************************

it is a security service that protects your web applications from hackers and bad traffic - like sql injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or bots - by letting you allow or block requests based on rules you set.

waf acts like a security guard for your website:-
1.it checks every visitor coming through your load balancer or CloudFront.
2.and decided whether to allow, block, or challenge them (using captcha).

waf works with:-
1.application load balancer (ALB)
2.amazon CloudFront (CDN)
3.API gateway
4.app runner / Cognito (optional integrations)

IP Sets:-
1.A list of IP addresses you want to allow or block.
2.Example: Allow office IPs, block suspicious ones.

WAF actions:-
1.allow ------- lets traffic through
2.block ------- denies the request (403 forbidden)
3.count ------- just logs request (useful for testing)
4.captcha ----- asks user to verify they are not a bot.
