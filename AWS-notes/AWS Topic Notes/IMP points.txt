AMI (amazon machine image):-

1.it is a pre-configured template that have the software information used to create new instance
2.it have the information required to launch instance, including os, application server, and application code.
3.with the help of ami we can launch multiple instances with the same coonfiguration
4.it can be stored in amazon s3 adn can shared with other aws accounts
5.its a complete copy of root file system of an instance including os and additional software installed on it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Snapshot:-

1.it is a backup of EBS volume
2.it is a point-in-time copy of data on an EBS volume and can be used to create a new EBS volume with the same data.
3.it is stored in amazon s3 and are incremental meaning only blocks that have changed since last snapshot are stored.
4.it can be used to create a new EBS volume to restore an existing volume, or to migrate data in new region
5.it can be used to backup EBS volume in aws 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Template:-

1.its a pre-defined configuration used to launch aws resources
2.it it used to automate the creation of resources in AWS and can be used to launch multiple resources with same configuration
3.it can be created using AWS cloudformation and they defined infrastructure as a code.
4.it can be used to automate creation of AWS resources such as EC2 instance, load balancer, and databases.
5.it can be versioned, and changes to template can be tracked using AWS cloudformation
6.it helps you to save time and reduce errors by automating process of creating and configuring resources in AWS

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Screenshot:-

1.it is a visual representation of what is displayed on screen of an instance
2.it can used to troubleshoot issue with instance or to confirm status of an instance
3.it can not be used to launch or manage resources or to create backups of data.
4.it can be taken from EC2 console or using aws CLI/API
5.if you take a screenshot it may expose sensitive information such as user credentials or confidential data. so must take of sensible information that may visible on 
  screenshot.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subnetting:-

1.it is a process of dividing a network into smaller subnetworks, or subnets.
2.it allow you to create more efficient use of IP addresses and manage network traffic more effectively.
3.it is use in LAN and WAN
4.it is typically done by dividing an IP address range into smaller ranges, each of which is assigned to a specific subnet.
5.each subnet has its own network address and broadcast address as well as range of IP addresses that can be used by devices in that subnet
6.it allow for bettar control and management of network traffic, as well as improved security.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CIDR (classless inter domain routing service):-

1.it is a method of allocating IP address and routing internet protocol (IP) packets.
2.it allow for more efficient use of IP address by using variable length subnet masks to divide network into smaller subnet
3.it replaces older classful addressing scheme, which was less flexible and less efficient.
4.CIDR notation used to represent IP addresses and subnet mask in a consise way
5.it uses slash to represent no of bits in subnet mask
6.both are used to create more efficient use of IP addresses, improve network management and increase security.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IAM-programmatic access:-

1.its a way to access aws services programatically using APIs or AWS command line interface insted of using aws management console
2.to use programmatic access, you need to create an IAM user or role and grant them the necessary permission to access aws services and resources
3.once you create a user or role, you can generate an access key and secret key that can be used to authenticate APIs request or CLI commands.
4.the access key and secret key are unique identifiers that allow aws to verify that the user or role is authorized to access the requested resources.
5.IAM also allow you to manage permission and policies for programmatic access, ensuring that only authorized users or roles can access the requested resources
6.IAM also provides logging and monitoring capabilities to track programmatic access and identity any potential security issue

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IAM-Identity centre:-

1.it is a central location in aws management console for managing and viewing information about IAM users and groups as well as their permission and access to aws 
  resources
2.it can be access through aws management console by selecting IAM service
3.from identity centre you can create new IAM users, groups or edit existing onces and define their access permission and policies.
4.IAM allows you to assign different access level to users and groups so that you can control which aws resources they can access and what action they can perform
5.identity centre also allows you to view and manage IAM credentials, such as access keys and passwords, for each IAM
6.it also allows you to view and manage IAM role which are used to delegates permission to AWs services and resorces to aws resources
7.it gives detailed information of user or group including password, policies, access key adn exp date
8.with help of these, you can identity and address any security issue or policies verification.

**Difference between on-premises and off-premises**

**On-Premises**

1.On-premises means we can host our IT resources in traditional way such as servers, networking equipment, and applications, within an organization's own physical data 
  centers or facilities. 
2.In this model, the organization is responsible for procuring, setting up, maintaining, and upgrading all the hardware and software infrastructure. 
3.The organization has full control over the hardware, networking, and security configurations. 
4.While this provides a high degree of control, it also comes with the overhead of managing the physical infrastructure, which can be expensive and time-consuming.

**Off-Premises (Cloud)**

1.Off-premises, often referred to as cloud computing, involves using remote servers and services provided by a third-party cloud provider, such as Amazon Web Services 
 (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and other cloud providers.
2.These cloud providers offer a range of services, including computing resources, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning, and more. 
3.Users can access and manage these resources over the internet without needing to own or maintain the underlying physical hardware.


In summary, the main differences between on-premises and off-premises (cloud) deployments in AWS are:

1.Ownership and Control:
    On-premises provides full ownership and control of hardware and software infrastructure, while off-premises/cloud shifts much of the infrastructure management  
    responsibility to the cloud provider.

2.Cost Model:
    On-premises requires upfront capital investment and ongoing maintenance costs, whereas off-premises/cloud typically follows a pay-as-you-go model, potentially 
    reducing upfront costs.

3.Scalability and Flexibility:
    Cloud services offer more scalability and flexibility to scale resources up or down quickly based on demand, compared to the limitations of on-premises 
    infrastructure.

4.Maintenance and Updates:
    Cloud providers manage maintenance, updates, and security patches, relieving users from these tasks in comparison to on-premises management.

5.Geographical Reach:
    Cloud services like AWS have a global network of data centers, providing wider geographical reach compared to the limited reach of on-premises data centers.

**What is server**

1.A server is like a powerful computer or machine that stores data and shares information or services over a network. 
2.It's designed to respond to requests from other computers, devices, or users and provide them with the data or functionality they need.
3.Think of a server as a central hub that holds and delivers resources, like web pages, files, or applications, to other devices, like your computer or smartphone, 
  when you ask for them.
4.Servers are used for various tasks, such as hosting websites, storing files, managing email, and running software applications that multiple users can access 
  remotely.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What is content delivery network**

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers strategically placed across various geographic locations to efficiently deliver web content, such 
  as images, videos, stylesheets, and scripts, to users.
2.The main goal of a CDN is to reduce latency, improve content delivery speed, and enhance the overall user experience by ensuring that content is served from a server 
  location that is physically closer to the user requesting it.
