									RELATIONAL DATABASE:-

relational database is a datastructure that allows you to store and link the information between the different table and different types of databuckets.

what is data:-
  data basically means the information or the details about the reference.

what is database:-
  its a systematic collection of data in a organise form.

1.relational database is a datastructure that store and allows you to link the information between the different tables and different types of databuckets.
2.tables are related to each other
3.all fields must be filled
4.it is best suited for oltp i.e online transaction processing
5.it supports the 8 type databases engines...
   1.mssql
   2.mysql
   3.mariadb
   4.postgresql
   5.aurora postgresql
   6.oracle
   7.amzon aurora
   8.IBM db2
6.every database has a unique key called as primary key (eg for banking its a account number)

RDS -> relational database service
its a fully managed aws service where aws is responsible for
1.security and patching
2.automated backup
3.software updates for the database engine
4.multi-az deployment ----> provides high availability and fault tolerance

1.types of templates
  1.production
  2.dev/test
  3.free-tier

PRACTICAL:-

1.create a database (RDS)
2.create a instance (EC2)
3.access the instance

1.yum install mariadb-server -y
2.systemctl start mariadb-server
3.systemctl enable mariadb-server

4.mysql -u root -h (endpoint) -pmayur
5.show databases;
6.use student_data;
6.create table student_info (name varchar(10),roll_no int,status varchar(10));
7.show tables;
8.describe student_info;
9.insert into student_info values ('user1',100,'pass');
  insert into student_info values ('user2',101,'fail');
  insert into student_info values ('user3',102,'pass');
10.select * from student_info;
11.select name from student_info where status='fail';

TO GET BACKUP OF DATA:-
mysqldump -u root -h (endpoint) -pmayur student_data > abc.bkp

mysql -u root -h (endpoint) -pmayur 
use student_data;
drop table student_info;

TO RETRIVE THE TABLE
mysql -u root -h (endpoint) -pmayur student_data < abc.bkp

mysql -u root -h (endpoint) -pmayur 
use student_data;
show tables;
select * from student_info;
