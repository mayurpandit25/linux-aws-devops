**EBS (elastic block storage)**

=======================================================================================================================================================================

**Two types of block store devices for EC2:-
   ( root/boot volume storage where operating system situated.)
    1.EBS (elastic block storage)
    2.Instance storage


a).EBS (elastic block storage):-(EBS backed EC2 instance)
   1.EBS volume behaves like ram,Unformatted,external block storage devices that you can attach to your EC2 instance.
   2.EBS vloumes are block storage devices suitable for database style data that requires frequient reads and writes.
   3.EBS volumes are attached to your EC2 instances through the aws network like virtual hard drives.
   4.an EBS volume can attach to a single EC2 instance only at a time.
   5.both EBS volume and EC2 instance must be in the same AZ.
   6.it is a persistant storage means if u have to stop or reboot the EC2 instance the data will not be deleted. but if you terminate the instance the data will be 
     deleted.(by default)
   7.but when we remove the delete on termination tick, the EBS volume should not be deleted even after deleting/terminating the EC2 instance.
   8.and its a network attached storage so its slow than instance storage.

b).Instance storage:-(instance backed EC2 instance)
   1.instance store backed EC2 basically the virtual hard drive on the host allocated to this EC2 instance.
   2.limited to 10GB per device.
   3.it is Emphemeral storage.(it is non persistant storage) means if u teminate the EC2 instance the data will be deleted. but suppose if u rebooted the instance the
     data will not be deleted. 
   4.the EC2 instance can't be stopped,can only be rebooted or teminated.
   5.Terminate will delete the data.
   6.and its a faster than EBS because it is a directly attach storage.

**EBS volume types:-

1.SSD backed volume(solid state drive)-------------------these are bootable means we can install OS in these drive we can use c drive in server
       1.general purpose (gp2,gp3)-----------------------default volume(gp2) 30GB.
       2.provisional IOPS (io2 block express,io1,io2)----data read and write 

2.HHD backed volume (hard disk drive)---------------------these are non-bootable means we can not install OS and we can use as D drive E drive for extra storage.                                                                                                          
       1.throughput optimized HDD (st1) data transfer in MB/sec
       2.cold HDD (sc1)

3.magnetic standard----------------------------------------these is bootable means we can install OS in these drive we can c drive in server


1>general purpose SSD (gp2):-
  1.gp2 is the default EBS volume type for the amazon EC2 instance.
  2.gp2 volumes are backed by SSDs
  3.general purpose , balances both price and performance.
  4.ratio of 3IOPS/GB with upto 10,000 IOPS(input/output per second)
  5.boot volume having low latency
  6.volume size -1GB-16TB

2>Provisional IOPS (io1):-
  1.these volumes are ideal for both IOPS intensive and throughput intensive workloads that require extremly low latency
    or for mission critical applications
  2.designed for I/O intensive application such as large relational or NOsQL databases.
  3.use if you need more than 10,000 IOPS
  4.can provision upto 32,000 IOPS per volume (64000 IOPS)
  5.volume size -44B-16TB

  5.Max IOPS/volume: 40-200

=======================================================================================================================================================================

**EBS snapshots of root volume**

 1.EBS snapshots are point-in-time images/copies of your EBS volume.
 2.any data written to the volume after the snapshot process is intiated, will not be included in the resulting snapshot (but will be included in future, incremental 
   update).
 3.per AWS account, upto 5000 EBS volumes can be created.
 4.per account, upto 10,000 EBS snapshots can be created.
 5.EBS snapshots are stored on s3, however you cannot access them directly you can only access them through EC2 APIs.
 6.while EBS volumes are AZ specific, snapshots are region specific. 
 7.any AZ in region can use snapshot to create EBS volume.
 8.to migrate an EBS from one AZ to another,create a snapshot (region specific) and create an EBS volume the snapshot in the intended AZ.
 9.you can create a snapshot to an EBS volume of the same or longer size than the original volume size,from which the snapshot was initially created.

=======================================================================================================================================================================

**EBS snapshots of non-root volume**

10.you can take a snapshot of a non-root EBS volume while the volume is in use on a running EC2 instance.
11.this means you can still access it while the snapshot is being proccessed.
12.however the snapshot will only include data that is already written to your volume.
13.the snapshot is created immediately,but it may stay in pending status untill the full snapshot is completed this takes few hours to complete , specially for the 
   first time snapshot of a volume
14.during the period, when the snapshot status is pendig, you can still access the volume (no-root) , but I/O might be slower because of the snapshot activity.
15.while in pending state , an in progress snapshot will not include data from ongoing reads and writes to the volumes
16.to take complete snapshot of your non-root volume -stop or unmount the volume.
17.to create a snapshot for a root EBS volume, you must stop the instance first then take the snapshot.  
18.EBS volume is AZ specific, snapshot are region specific also we can copy that snapshot and send to the another region.

=======================================================================================================================================================================

**EBS incremental snapshots**

 1.EBS snapshots are stored incrementally. 
 2.for low cost storage on s3 and a guarantee to be able to fully restore data from the snapshots.
 3.what you need is a single snapshot then further snapshots will only carry the changed blocks (incremental updates)
 4.therefore you do not need to have multiple full/complete copies of the snapshot.
 5.you are charged for-
      --data transfered to s3 from your EBS volume you are taking snapshot 
      --snapshot stored in s3
      --first snapshot is a clone subsequent snapshots are incremental.
 6.deleting snapshot will only remove data exclusive to the snapshot.
 7.In EBS, the data will be stored in a block storage form so when we create a snapshot of a volume and the data will be not fully
   stored in volume means the volume blocks are empty the aws can intelligenly take a snapshot of only the stored block data.and when 
   we add object in a blocks so the blocks are updated so when take a snapshot of volume only the udated blocks are stored in a snapshot
   because aws can only store updated blocks intelligently.so when we delete the 1st snapshot amazon aws can send the snapshot 1 data to 
   the snapshot 2 so that the data will not be deleted.and when we create a volume of the snapshot it can retrive all the data only you 
   give the original storage as well as large storage but not give less storage.in less storage it can not be created.

=========================================================================================================================================

**EBS encryption**

 1.EBS encryption is supported on all EBS volumes types and all EC2 instance families.
 2.snapshots of encrypted volumes are also encrypted.
 3.creating on EBS volume from an encrypted snapshot will result it an encrypted volume
 4.data encryption at rest means , encryption data while it is stored on the data storage device.
 5.there are many ways you can encrypt data on an EBS volume is attached to an EC2 instance.
     -use 3rd party EBS volume
     -encryption tools
     -use encrypted 
 6.encrypt data at the application level before storing it to the volume.
 7.use encrypted file system on the top of the EBS volume
 8.encrypted volume are accessed exactly like encrypted ones, basically encryption is handled transperantly
 9.you can attach an encrypted and unencrypted volumes to the same EC2 instance.
10.remember that the EBS volumes are not physically attached to the EC2 instance, rather they are virtually attached thorugh the EBS infrastructure.
11.this means when you encrypt data on an EBS volume, data is actually encrypted on the EC2 instance than transferred, encrypted to be stored on the EBS volume
12.these means data in transit between EC2 and encrypted EBS volume is also encrypted.
13.there is no direct way to change the encryption state of the volume.
14.to change the state (indirectly) you need to follow either of the following two ways-
     1.attach a new, encrypted, EBS volume to the EC2 instance that has the data to be encrypted then,
     2.mount the new volume to the EC2 instance copy the data from the un-encrypted volume to the new volume.
     3.both volumes must be on the same EC2 instance.

                                         or

 Create a snapshot of the unencrypted volume.
 Copy the snapshot and choose encryption for the new copy, this will create an encrypted copy of the snapshot.
 Use this new copy to create an EBS volume which will be encrypt too.
 Attach the new encrypted EBS volume to the EC2 instance. 

=======================================================================================================================================================================

**Root EBS Volume Encryption**

 There is no direct way to change the encryption state of a volume.
 There is an indirect work around to this:
      Launch the instance with the EBS volume required.
      Do whatever patching of install applications.
      Create an AMI from the EC2 instance.
      Copy the AMI and choose encryption while copying.
      This results it an encrypted AMI that is private (yours only).
      Use the encrypted AMI to launch new EC2 instances which will have their EBS root volume3 encrypted.

**EBS Encryption Key**
 To encrypt a volume or snapshot, you need an encryption key, these keys are called customer master key (CMK) and are managed by AWS key management service (KMS).
 When encrypting the first EBS volume, AWS KMS creates a default CMK key.
 This key is used for your first volume encryption of snapshots created from this volumes and subsequent volumes created from these snapshots.
 After that each newly encrypted volume is encrypted with a unique/ separate AES-256 bit encryption key. This key is used to encrypt the volume, its snapshot and any
  volumes created of its snapshots.

**Changing Encryption Key**
 You cannot change the encryption (CMK) key used to encrypt an existing encrypted snapshot or encrypted EBS volume.
 If you want to change the key, create a copy of the snapshot and specify during the copy process that you want to re-encrypt the copy with a different key.
 This comes in handy when you have a snapshot that was encrypted using your default CMK key and you want to change the key in order to able to share the snapshot 
   with other accounts.

=======================================================================================================================================================================

**Sharing EBS Snapshot**

 By default only the account owner can create volumes from the account snapshots.
 You can share your unencrypted snapshots with the AWS community by making them public.
 Also you can share your unencrypted snapshots with a selected AWS account by making them private then selecting the AWS accounts to share with.
 You cannot make your encrypted snapshots public.
 You cannot make a snapshot of an encrypted EBS volume public on AWS.
 You can share your encrypted snapshot with specific AWS account as follows:
        Make sure that you use a non-default/custom CMK key to encrypt the snapshot, not the default CMK key (AWS will not allow the sharing if default CMK is used.)
        Configure cross account permissions in order to give the account with which you want to share the snapshot access to the custom CMK key used to encrypt
         the snapshot.
        Without this the other account will not be able to copy the snapshots nor will be able to create volumes of the snapshots.
 AWS will not allow you to share snapshots encrypted using your default CMK key.
 For the AWS account with whom an encrypted snapshot is shared.
        They must first create their own copies of the snapshot.
        Then they use that copy to restore/create EBS volume.
 You can make a copy of the snapshot when it has been fully saved to S3 (its status show as complete) and not during the snapshot’s pending status (when data blocks
   are being moved to S3).
 Amazon S3 server side encryption (SSE) protect the snapshot data-in-transit while copying.
 You can have up to 5 snapshots copy request running in a single destination per account.
