									   **AUTOSCALING**
  
=======================================================================================================================================================================

  1.it is a service which is provided by aws to autoscale up and scale down the instances based on the demand for your application.
  2.autoscaling helps you save cost by cutting down the number of EC2 instances when not needed and scaling out to add the instances when it is required.
  3.it works on the scaling policies that we can attach to the autoscaling group.
  4.When the demand for your application is increases, autoscaling will automatically add the instances to handle the load.
  5.Conversely,when the demand for your application is decreases, autoscaling will automatically remove unnecessary instances to save the cost.
  6.autoscaling in AWS is a powerful feature that can help you optimize your compute resources and improve the performance and scalability of your application or  
    service.


TYPES OF SCALING:-
  
   a).Vertical scaling:
       1.With vertical autoscaling, you can add or remove CPU, memory, storage, or other resources to an instance to increase or decrease its capacity.
       2.In other words, it involves adding more resources to an existing instance, rather than adding more instances.
    
   B).Horizontal scaling:-
       1.Horizontal scaling involves adding more instances to a system to handle increased demand or workload.
       2.Horizontal scaling is often used for applications or services that experience high traffic or workload spikes, where additional computing resources are needed 
         to handle the increased demand.
       3.Horizontal scaling can be more cost-effective than vertical scaling (scaling up), as adding additional smaller instances is often cheaper than adding more 
         resources to a single larger instance.

**Difference between launch configuration and launch template:-
 
  1.launch configuration:-1.it is a older format for creating a instance.
                          1.it is a instance configuration template used with autoscaling group to create a instance. 
                          2.it can be associated with multiple ASGs. 
                          3.after creating an instance with the help of launch configuration we can not modify them.
                          4.we have to create new instance and attach to the autoscaling group if any modification is 
                            required.    
                          5.Basic or detailed monitoring for the instances in the ASG can be enabled when a launch 
                            configuration is created.

                                
  2.launch template-----:-1.it is a newer format or more flexible format to create a instance.
                          2.it is a template which is used to launch an instance using EC2 console.
                          3.after creating an instance we can also modify them.
                          4.it enable you to store the ami,instance type,security groups,and key pair etc.so that you do not need to 
                            define these parameters every time when you launch an instance.
                          5.Launch templates allow you to maintain and update your instances in a more efficient way.
                          6.it allows multiple versions of a template to be defined.
                          7.it allows the selection of both Spot and On-Demand Instances or multiple instance types.
                          8.it supports EC2 Dedicated Hosts. Dedicated Hosts are physical servers with EC2 instance 
                            capacity that are dedicated to your use.
                          9.it Supports the multiple instance types and purchase options in a single ASG.
           
    In summary, while both launch configuration and launch template can be used to launch instances in AWS, launch templates offer 
    more advanced customization options, greater flexibility, and easier maintenance and management compared to launch configurations.
