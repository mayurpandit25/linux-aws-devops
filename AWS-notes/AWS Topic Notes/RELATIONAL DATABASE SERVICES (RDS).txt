                                                                  **RELATIONAL DATABASE SERVICES (RDS)**

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What is DATA**
    In simple words, data can be facts related to any object. For e.g: your age, job, house no, contact no., name, places are some data related to you.


**What is DATABASE**
    Database is a systematic collection of data in a organise form. Databases supports storage and manipulation of data.
  e.g: facebook, telecom companies, amazon.com


**What is DBMS**
    DBMS is a collection of programs which enable its users to access database, manipulate data, reporting/ representation of data.


**Types of DBMS**
   1. Hierarchical
   2. Network
   3. Relational
   4. Object oriented

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RELATIONAL DATABASE:-(MySQL)
 A relational database is a data structure that allows you to link information from different tables of different types of data bucket.
 Tables are related to each other.
 All fields must be filled.
 Best suited for OLTP (online transaction processing)
 Relational DB: MySQL, Oracle, DBMS, IBM DB2
 A row of a table is also called records. It contains the specific information of each individual entry in the table.
 Each table has its own primary key.
 A schema (design of database) is used to strictly define tables, columns, indexes and relation between tables.
 Relational DB are usually used in enterprises application/scenario. Exception in MySQL which is used for web application.
 Common application for MySQL include php and java based web applications that requires a database storage backend. E.g: JOOMLA
 Cannot scale out horizontally.
 Virtually all relational DB uses SQL.

static content ------> predefined Shema -------> vertical scalable

NON-RELATIONAL DATABASE:-(no-sql)
 Non-relational databases store data without a structured mechanism to link data from different tables to one another.
 Required low cost hardware.
 Much faster performance (read/write) compared to relational DBs.
 Horizontal scaling is possible.
 Never provide tables with flat fixed column records. It means schema-free.
 Best suited for online analytical processing (OLAP).
 E.g: of NoSQL databases: MongoDB, Casssandra, DynamoDB, Postegre, Raven,Redis.


unstructured data ----------> dynamic schema --------> horizontality scalable

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Types of No-SQL Databases**
    1.Columnar Database (cassandra, HBase)
    2.Document Databse (MongoDB, CouchDB, RavenDB)
    3.Key Value Database (Redis, Riak, DynamoDB, Tokyo Cabinet)
    4.Graph Based Database (Neo4J, FlockDB)

1. Columnar Database:
 A columnar database is a DBMS that stores data in columns instead of Rows.
 In a columnar DB all the column-1 values are physically together followed by all the column-2 values.
 In a row oriented DBMS the data would be stored like this: (1, bob, 30, 8000: 2, arun, 26, 4000: 3, vian, 39, 2000 ;)
 In a column based DBMS the database would be stored like this: (1, 2, 3: bob, arun, vian; 30, 26, 39; 8000, 4000, 2000 ;)
 Benefit is that because a column based DBMS is self-indexing, it uses less disk space that a RDBMS containing the same data. It easily perform operation like
   min, max, average.

2. Document Database:
 Document DB make it easier for developer to store and querying data in a DB by using the same document model format they use in their application code.
 Document DBs are efficient for storing catalogue.
 Store semi-structure data as document typically in JSON or XML format. (example)
 A document database is a great choice for contain management application such as blogs and video platform.

3. Key-Value Database:
 A key-value DB is a simple DB that uses an associative array (like dictionary) as a fundamental model where each key is associated with one and only one
  value in a collection.
 It allows horizontal scaling.
 Used cases: shopping cart, and session store in app like fb and twitter.
 They improve application performance by storing critical pieces of data in memory for low latency access.
 Amazon elasticache as an in-memory key-value stores.

4. Graph Based Database:
 A graph DB is basically a collection of nodes and edges.
 Each node represent an entity and each edges represent a connection or relationship between two nodes.
 In an AWS fully managed relational DB engines service where AWS is responsible for:
     Security and patching.
     Automated backup.
     Software updates for DB engine.
     If selected multi AZ with synchronous replication between the active and stand by DB instances.
     Automatic failover if multi AZ option was selected.
     By default, every DB has weekly maintenance window. (max 35 days.) Settings managed by the users:
     Managing DB settings.
     Creating relational database schema.
     Database performance tuning.

**What is Multi-AZ in RDS**
   You can select multi AZ option during RDS DB instance launch. 
   RDS service creates a standby instances in a different AZ in the same region and configure “synchronous replication” between the primary and standby.  
   You cannot read/write to the standby RDS DB instances.
   You cannot select which AZ in the region will be chosen to create the standby DB instance.
   You can however view, which AZ is selected after the standby is created.
   Depending on the instance class it may take 1 to few minutes to failover to the standby instance.
   AWS recommends the use of provisioned IOPS instances for multi-AZ RDS instance.

**When Multi-AZ RDS Failover Triggers**
    In case of failure of primary DB instance failure.
    In case of AZ failure.
    Loss of network connectivity to primary DB.
    Loss of primary EC2 instance failure.
    EBS failure of primary DB instance.
    The primary DB instance is changed.
    Patching the O.S of the DB instance.
    Manual failover. (in case of rebooting.)

**Multi-AZ RDS Failover Consequences**
 During failover the CNAME of the RDS DB instance is updated to map to the standby IP address.
 It is recommended to use the end point to reference your DB instances and not its IP address.
 The CNAME doesn’t change because the RDS endpoint doesn’t change.
 RDS end point doesn’t change by selecting multi-AZ option, however the primary and standby instances will have different IP addresses, as they are in different AZ.
 It is always recommended that you do not use the IP address to point RDS instances, always use endpoint. By using endpoint there will be no change whenever a  
   failover happens.

**When we do manual failover**
 In case of rebooting.
 This is by selecting the “reboot with failover” reboot options on the primary RDS DB instances.
 A DB instance reboot is required for changes to take effect when you change the DB parameter group on when you change a static DB parameter.
 Whenever failover occurs AWS RDS sends SNS notification.
 You can use API calls to find out the RDS events occurred in the last 14 days.
 Even you can use CLI to view last 14 days events.
 Using AWS console you can only last one day events
 In case of OS patching, system upgrades and DB scaling, these things happens on standby first then on primary to avoid outage.
 In multi-AZ, snapshots and automated backups are done on standby instance to avoid I/O suspension on primary.

**RDS Multi-AZ Deployment Maintenance**
 Firstly perform maintenance of standby.
 Now convert standby into primary so that maintenance can be done on primary.(currently)
 You can manually upgrade a DB instance to a supported DB engine version from AWS console as follows:- RDS->DB instance->modify DB->set DB engine version.
 By default change will take effect during the next maintenance window.
 Or you can force a immediate upgrade if you want.
 In multi-AZ version upgrade will be conducted by both primary and standby at the same time which will cause an outage.
 Do it during maintenance window.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**There are two methods to backup and restore your RDS DB instances:
1. AWS RDS automated backup
2. User initiated manual backup

 Either you can take backup of entire DB instance or just the DB.
 You can create a restore volume snapshots of your entire DB instances.
 Automated backups by AWS, backup your DB data to multiple AZ to provide for data durability.
 Select-automated backup in AWS console.
 Stored in Amazon S3.
 Multi-AZ automated backups will be taken from the standby instance.
 The DB instance must be in “ACTIVE” state for automated backup.
 RDS automatically backups the DB instances daily by creating a storage volume snapshots of your DB instance (fully daily snapshots) including the DB transaction 
  logs.
 You can decide when you would like to take backup (window)
 No additional charge for RDS backing up your DB instance.
 For multi-AZ deployment, backups are taken from the standby DB instance (true for Maria DB, MySQL, Oracle, Postgre SQL).
 Automated backups are deleted when you delete your RDS DB instance.
 An outage occurs if you change the backup retention period from zero to non-zero value or the other way around.
 Retention period of automate backup is 7 days (by default) via AWS console.
 AWS Aurora is an exception. Its default is 1 day.
 Via CLI or API 1 day by default.
 You can increase it up to 35 days.
 If you don’t want backup, put zero “0” in the retention period.
 In case of manual snapshot, point-in-time recovery is not possible.
 Manual snapshot is also stored in S3.
 They are not deleted automatically, if you delete RDS instance.
 Take a final snapshot before deleting your RDS DB instance.
 You can share manual snapshot directly with other AWS Account.
 When you restore a DB instance only the default DB parameters and security groups are associated with the restored instance.
 You cannot restore a DB snapshot into an existing DB instance rather it has to create a new DB instance it has new endpoint.
 Restoring from the backup or a DB snapshot changes the RDS instance endpoint.
 At the time of restoring, you can change the storage type (general purpose or provisioned.)
 You cannot encrypt an existing unencrypted DB instance.
 To do that you need to: create a new encrypted instance and migrate your data to it (from unencrypted to encrypted) or you can restore from a backup/snapshot into a
   new encrypted RDS instance.
 RDS supports encryption-at-rest for all DB engines using KMS.
 What actually encrypted when data-at-rest:
      a.All its snapshots.
      b.Backups of DB (S3 storage.)
      c. Data on EBS volume.
      d. Read replica created from the snapshots.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Some points related to RDS Billings:
 No upfront cost.
 You have to pay only for:
     a.DB instance hours (partial hour charged as full hours)
     b.Storage GB/month.
     c.Internet data transfer.
     d.Backup storage (i.e S3)

This is increases by increasing DB backup’s retention period.

**Also charged for**
a. Multi-AZ DB hours.
b. Provisioned stage (multi-AZ)
c. Double write I/O
d. You are nor charged for DB data transfer during replication from primary to standby.
