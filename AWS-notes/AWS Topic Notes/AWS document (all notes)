**cloud:-
    It is a sharing of resources from a remote location or accessing this resources via internet on pay as you go model.


2.cloud computing:-
   It enables on demand delivery services like computing,storage,database,networking,etc. and also the other It resources 
   accessed through cloud service platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go model. 

 
**There are the following operations that we can do using cloud computing:
• Developing new applications and services
• Storage, back up, and recovery of data Hosting blogs and websites
• Delivery of software on demand 
• Streaming videos and audios
• Analysis of data


**Why Cloud Computing?
1.Small as well as large IT companies, follow the traditional methods to provide the IT infrastructure. That means for any
  IT company, we need a Server Room that is the basic need of IT companies.
2.In that server room, there should be a database server, mail server, networking, firewalls, routers, modem, switches, QPS 
  (Query Per Second means how much queries or  load will be handled by the server),configurable system, high net speed, and 
  the maintenance engineers.
3.To establish such IT infrastructure, we need to spend lots of money.To overcome all these problems and to reduce the IT
  infrastructure cost, Cloud Computing comes into existence.

9.cloud deployment models:----1.public cloud
                              2.private cloud
                              3.hybrid cloud
                              4.community


A.public cloud:
  1.public cloud is open to all to store and access information via the internet using pay-per usage method.
  2.In public cloud,computing resources are managed and operated by cloud service provider.
  3.Public clouds offer a high level of redundancy and availability, with multiple data centers and failover mechanisms in 
    place to ensure that services are always available. 
  4.Public clouds provide a range of computing services, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking, that can be 
    accessed by multiple organizations or users.     
                    
  Advantages:-
    1.it is owned at lower cost than private and hybrid cloud.
    2.it is maintained by cloud service provider,so do not need to worry about the maintaince.
    3.it is easier to integrate.Hence it offery cloud service as a better flexibility approach to consumers.
    4.it's location is independant because its services are delivered through the internet.
    5.it is highly scalable as per requirement of computing resources.

  Disadvantages:-
    1.it is less secure because resources are shared publicaly.
    2.performance depends upon the high-speed internet network.
    3.the client has no control of data.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

B.private cloud:-
   1.it is a cloud which is used by big organisation for storing the data and accessing the data within a single organisation.
   2.In a private cloud, the computing resources (such as servers, storage, and networking) are owned and managed by the
     organization, rather than a third-party provider.
   3.it is also known as internal cloud or corporate cloud.
   4.Private clouds are typically used by organizations that have strict security, compliance, or regulatory requirements that 
     prevent them from using public cloud services. 
   5.Private clouds can be used to provide a range of cloud computing services, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking,
     to internal users and external customers.
   6.Private clouds provide greater control and customization options than public clouds, allowing organizations to tailor their
     cloud environment to their specific needs.
  
  Advantages:-
    1.private cloud provides a high level of security and privacy to the users.
    2.private cloud offers a high level of performance with improved speed. 
    3.it allows the IT team to quickly allocate and deliver on-demand IT resources.
    4.the organisation has full control over the cloud because it is managed by the organization itself.
    5.data security is the first priority.

  Disadvantages:-
    1.skilled people are required to manage and operate cloud services.
    2.private cloud accissible within the organisation,so the area of operation is limited.
    3.it is not suitable for organization which have high user base.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C.hybrid cloud:
   1.it is a combination of public cloud and private cloud.
   2.hybrid cloud=public cloud + private cloud.
   3.it is partially secure because the services which are running on the public can be accessed by anyone,while the services.
     which are running on the private cloud can not be accessed anyone.
   4.example:-Google application suite (Gmail,google apps,google drive),Office 365 (MS office on the web and one drive)
     amazon web service.

  Advantages:-
    1.it is suitable for those organization which require more security than the public cloud.
    2.it helps you to deliver new products and services more quickly.
    3.it provides an excellent way to reduce the risk.
    4.it offers flexible resources because of the public cloud and secure resources.
  
  Disadvantages:-
    1.in hybrid cloud security is not good as the private cloud.
    2.managing a hybrid cloud is complex because it is difficult to manage more than one type of deployment model.
    3.in hybrid cloud,the reliability of the services depends on cloud service providers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
D.community cloud:
   1.it allows systems and services to be accessible by a group of several oraganization to share the information between 
     the oraganization
   2.example--health care community cloud

  Advantages:-
    1.it is cost-effective because the whole cloud is being shared by several organization or communities
    2.community cloud is suitable for organization that want to have a collaborative.
    3.cloud with more security features than the public cloud.
    4.it provides collaborative and distributive environment.
    5.it allows you to share cloud resources,infrastructure,and other capabilities among various organizations.
   
  Disadvantages:-
    1.it is not a good choice for every organization.
    2.security features is not good as the private cloud.it is not suitable if there is no collaboration.
    3.the fixed amount of data storage and bandwidth is shared among all community.

===========================================================================================================================

**Benefits of cloud computing:-

1.Scalability: 
    Cloud computing allows businesses to easily scale their computing resources up or down to meet changing demands.
    This means that businesses can easily accommodate spikes in traffic or usage without having to invest in additional 
    hardware or infrastructure.

2.Cost savings:
    Cloud computing can be more cost-effective than traditional on-premises computing because businesses only pay for the 
    resources they use. This eliminates the need for upfront investments in hardware and infrastructure, and can also reduce 
    ongoing maintenance costs.

3.Increased agility: 
   Cloud computing allows businesses to rapidly deploy new applications and services, enabling them to respond more quickly
   to changing business needs and market conditions.

4.Accessibility:
    Cloud computing allows users to access their applications and data from anywhere with an internet connection, making it 
    easier to collaborate and work remotely.

5.Reliability: 
   Cloud computing providers typically offer high levels of availability and uptime, which can help ensure that business-
   critical applications and services are always available when needed.

6.Security:
   Cloud computing providers typically offer a range of security features and controls to help protect customer data and
   applications from cyber threats and other security risks.

6)Deploy globally in minutes:-
   With the cloud, you can expand to new geographic regions and deploy globally in minutes. For example, 
   AWS has infrastructure all over the world, so you can deploy your application in multiple physical locations with just
   a few clicks. Putting applications in closer proximity to end users reduces latency and improves their experience.  

=========================================================================================================================

**Region:-
  
  1.aws region are separate geographic area that aws used to house in its infrastructure there are distributed around the
    world so that customer can choose a region closet to them in order to host their cloud infrastructure there.
  2.the closer your region is to you the bettar so that you can reduce network latency as much as possible for your end 
    user, you want to be near data center for cast service.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Availability zone:-

  1.an availability zone is logical building block that makes up aws region.
  2.there are 69 availability zones which are isolated location data centre wihtin region.
  3.each region has multiple availability zones.
  4.each region has 3 availability zones.
  5.when you design your infrastructure to have backup of data in other availability zones.

==========================================================================================================================

**EC2 instances(elastic compute cloud):-

  1.it is used to launch virtual server,virtual machine etc.
  2.it provides scalable computing capacity in aws cloud.
  3.you can use amazon EC2 to launch as many or few virtual servers as your needs,configure security and networking and 
    manage storage.
  4.it enables you to scale up or scale down the instances.
  5.it is having two storage options i.e. EBS and instance store.instant store is fast but it is also non-persistant storage
  6.pre-configured templates are available known as amazon machine image (AMI).
  7.by default,when you create on EC2 account with amazon,your account is limited to maximum of 20 instances per EC2  
    region with two dafault high I/0 instances.
 
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Types of EC2 instances:-

    1.general purpose-------------(e.g., A,T,M) 
         it generally provides balance memory, and cpu and resources that can be used for vanety of workload.
       
          a)A---------------webserver
                            containernarized microservers
                            distributed data stores
                            application that requires ARM instrument set
          b)T--------base performance
                     website and webapp
                     code repositories
                     development , build test
                     microservices
          c)M----generally used for broad application, provides balance compute, memory and networking resources (EBS and nvme ssd)


    2.compute optimised------------(e.g., C )
         for fault processing, high level performance
    
     
    3.memory optimised------------(e.g. R,X,Z)
         provides large ram for workloads that process larger that set in memory.
    
        a)X-----for high performance database,relational database workloads. (banking)
        b)R-----high performance,relational (mysql) and nosql (mangodb) database.
        c)Z-----high frequency deliver a sustain or core frequency of upto 4.0 GZ, the fastest of any cloud instance.

    4.storage optimised------------(e.g., H,I,D)
         it requires for high workload that require high,sequential read and write access to very large data ste on cloud
         storage.it also provide low latency for high data transfer.
    
    5.accelerated computing--------(e.g F,P,G)
         graphics optimised, it is generally used for gaming or you can also run 3D application. and also used in machine 
         learning, deep learning graphic processing.

    6.high memory optimised--------(e.g U)
         it is run on dedicated host to runs large in memory database.

    7.previous generation
 
=====================================================================================================================================

**Two types of block store devices for EC2:-
   ( root/boot volume storage where operating system situated.)
    1.EBS (elastic block storage)
    2.Instance storage


a).EBS (elastic block storage):-(EBS backed EC2 instance)
   1.EBS volume behaves like ram,Unformatted,external block storage devices that you can attach to your EC2 instance.
   2.EBS vloumes are block storage devices suitable for database style data that requires frequient reads and writes.
   3.EBS volumes are attached to your EC2 instances through the aws network like virtual hard drives.
   4.an EBS volume can attach to a single EC2 instance only at a time.
   5.both EBS volume and EC2 instance must be in the same AZ.
   6.it is a persistant storage means if u have to stop or reboot the EC2 instance the data will not be deleted.
     but if you terminate the instance the data will be deleted.(by default)
   7.but when we remove the delete on termination tick, the EBS volume should not be deleted even after deleting/terminating
     the EC2 instance.
   8.and its a network attached storage so its slow than instance storage.

b).Instance storage:-(instance backed EC2 instance)
   1.instance store backed EC2 basically the virtual hard drive on the host allocated to this EC2 instance.
   2.limited to 10GB per device.
   3.it is Emphemeral storage.(it is non persistant storage) means if u teminate the EC2 instance the data will be deleted.
     but suppose if u rebooted the instance the data will not be deleted. 
   4.the EC2 instance can't be stopped,can only be rebooted or teminated.
   5.Terminate will delete the data.
   6.and its a faster than EBS because it is a directly attach storage.
  
===================================================================================================================================

**EBS volume types:-

1.SSD backed volume(solid state drive)-----these are bootable means we can install OS in these drive we can use c drive in server
       1.general purpose (gp2,gp3)-----------------------default volume(gp2) 30GB.
       2.provisional IOPS (io2 block express,io1,io2)----data read and write 

2.HHD backed volume (hard disk drive)-----these are non-bootable means we can not install OS and we can use as D drive E drive
                                                                                                              for extra storage.
       1.throughput optimized HDD (st1) data transfer in MB/sec
       2.cold HDD (sc1)

3.magnetic standard-----------------------these is bootable means we can install OS in these drive we can c drive in server


1>general purpose SSD (gp2):-
  1.gp2 is the default EBS volume type for the amazon EC2 instance.
  2.gp2 volumes are backed by SSDs
  3.general purpose , balances both price and performance.
  4.ratio of 3IOPS/GB with upto 10,000 IOPS(input/output per second)
  5.boot volume having low latency
  6.volume size -1GB-16TB

2>Provisional IOPS (io1):-
  1.these volumes are ideal for both IOPS intensive and throughput intensive workloads that require extremly low latency
    or for mission critical applications
  2.designed for I/O intensive application such as large relational or NOsQL databases.
  3.use if you need more than 10,000 IOPS
  4.can provision upto 32,000 IOPS per volume (64000 IOPS)
  5.volume size -44B-16TB
  
3>throughput optimized HDD (st1):-
  1.st1 is backed by hard disk drives and is ideal for frequently accessed,throughput intensive workloads with large datasets.
  2.st1 volumes deliver performance in term of throughput, measured in MB/s
  3.big data, data warehouse, log processing
  4.it cannot be a boot volume 
  5.can provisioned upto 500 IOPS per volume
  6.volume size -500GB-16TB

4>cold HDD (sc1):-
  1.sc1 is also backed by HDD and provides the lowest cost per GB of all EBS volume types.
  2.lowest cost storage for infrequent access workloads.
  3.used in file servers.
  4.cannot be a boot volume
  5.can provisioned upto 250 IOPS per volume.
  6.volume size -500GB-16TB 

====================================================================================================================================

**EBS snapshots**

 1.EBS snapshots are point-in-time images/copies of your EBS volume.
 2.any data written to the volume after the snapshot process is intiated , will not be included in the resulting snapshot (but will
   be included in future, incremental update).
 3.per AWS account, upto 5000 EBS volumes can be created.
 4.per account, upto 10,000 EBS snapshots can be created.
 5.EBS snapshots are stored on s3, however you cannot access them directly you can only access them through EC2 APIs.
 6.while EBS volumes are AZ specific, snapshots are region specific. 
 7.any AZ in region can use snapshot to create EBS volume.
 8.to migrate an EBS from one AZ to another,create a snapshot (region specific) and create an EBS volume the snapshot in the intended
   AZ.
 9.you can create a snapshot to an EBS volume of the same or longer size than the original volume size,from which the snapshot was 
   initially created.
10.you can take a snapshot of a non-root EBS volume while the volume is in use on a running EC2 instance.
11.this means you can still access it while the snapshot is being proccessed.
12.however the snapshot will only include data that is already written to your volume.
13.the snapshot is created immediately,but it may stay in pending status untill the full snapshot is completed this takes few hours
   to complete , specially for the first time snapshot of a volume
14.during the period, when the snapshot status is pendig, you can still access the volume (no-root) , but I/O might be slower because
   of the snapshot activity.
15.while in pending state , an in progress snapshot will not include data from ongoing reads and writes to the volumes
16.to take complete snapshot of your non-root volume -stop or unmount the volume.
17.to create a snapshot for a root EBS volume, you must stop the instance first then take the snapshot.  
18.EBS volume is AZ specific, snapshot are region specific also we can copy that snapshot and send to the another region.

=======================================================================================================================================

**EBS incremental snapshots**

 1.EBS snapshots are stored incrementally 
 2.for low cost storage on s3 and a guarantee to be able to fully restore data from the snapshots.
 3.what you need is a single snapshot then further snapshots will only carry the changed blocks (incremental updates)
 4.therefore you do not need to have multiple full/complete copies of the snapshot.
 5.you are charged for-
      --data transfered to s3 from your EBS volume you are taking snapshot 
      --snapshot stored in s3
      --first snapshot is a clone subsequent snapshots are incremental.
 6.deleting snapshot will only remove data exclusive to the snapshot.
 7.In EBS, the data will be stored in a block storage form so when we create a snapshot of a volume and the data will be not fully
   stored in volume means the volume blocks are empty the aws can intelligenly take a snapshot of only the stored block data.and when 
   we add object in a blocks so the blocks are updated so when take a snapshot of volume only the udated blocks are stored in a snapshot
   because aws can only store updated blocks intelligently.so when we delete the 1st snapshot amazon aws can send the snapshot 1 data to 
   the snapshot 2 so that the data will not be deleted.and when we creata a volume of the snapshot it can retrive all the data only you 
   give the original storage as well as large storage but not give less storage.in less storage it can not be created.

=========================================================================================================================================

**EBS encryption**

 1.EBS encryption is supported on all EBS volumes types and all EC2 instance families.
 2.snapshots of encrypted volumes are also encrypted.
 3.creating on EBS volume from an encrypted snapshot will result it an encrypted volume
 4.data encryption at rest means , encryption data while it is stored on the data storage device.
 5.there are many ways you can encrypt data on an EBS volume is attached to an EC2 instance.
     -use 3rd party EBS volume
     -encryption tools
     -use encrypted 
 6.encrypt data at the application level before storing it to the volume.
 7.use encrypted file system on the top of the EBS volume
 8.encrypted volume are accessed exactly like encrypted ones, basically encryption is handled transperantly
 9.you can attach an encrypted and unencrypted volumes to the same EC2 instance.
10.remember that the EBS volumes are not physically attached to the EC2 instance, rather they are virtually attached thorugh the EBS 
   infrastructure.
11.this means when you encrypt data on an EBS volume, data is actually encrypted on the EC2 instance than transferred, encrypted to be stored
   on the EBS volume
12.these means data in transit between EC2 and encrypted EBS volume is also encrypted.
13.there is no direct way to change the encryption state of the volume.
14.to change the state (indirectly) you need to follow either of the following two ways-
     1.attach a new, encrypted, EBS volume to the EC2 instance that has the data to be encrypted then,
     2.mount the new volume to the EC2 instance copy the data from the un-encrypted volume to the new volume.
     3.both volumes must be on the same EC2 instance.

**EC2 purchasing option:-
===>1.on demand
    2.dedicated instance-------its price depends on the on demand
    3.dedicated host-----------its price also depends on the on demand--bare metal
===>4.spot instance
    5.schedule instance--------its price depends on the reserved instance
===>6.reserved instance

1.there are four ways to pay for amazon EC2 instance i.e. On demand,reserved instance and spot instance
2.you can also pay for dedicated host which provide you with EC2 instance capacity on physical servers dedicated for your use.

1.On demand:-
  1.aws on demand instances are virtual servers that runs in aws or aws relational databases service(RDS) and are purchased at a 
    fixed rate per hour.
  2.aws recommends using on-demand instances for application with short term irregular workloads that cannot be interuppted.
  3.they are also suitable for use during testing and development of application on EC2.
  4.with on-demand instance you only pay for EC2 instances you use.
  5.the use of on-demand instances frees you from the cost and complexities of planning,purchasing, and monitoring hardware
    and tranforms what are commonly large fixed costs into much smaller variable cost.
  6.pricing is per instance-hour consumed for each instance,from the time an instance is launched until it is terminatd or stopped.
  7.each partial instance hour consumes will be billed per second for linux instances and as a full hour for all other instance types.

 *base point:-1.purchased at fixed rate per hour
             2.only pay for consume time
             3.irregular workloads and short term workloads.
             4.testing and development
             5.for linux is bill per second and for other instances it is per hour

2.Dedicated instance:-
  1.dedicated instances are run in a vpc on hardware that is dedicated to a single customer. 
  2.your dedicated instances are physically isolated at the host hardware level instances that belong to other aws account
  3.dedicated instances may share hardware with other instances from the same AWS account that are not dedicated instance.
  4.pay for dedicated instances on-demand save upto 70% by purchsing reserved instances,or save upto 90% by purchasing spot instance.
  
3.Dedicated host:-
  1.an amazon EC2 dedicated host is a physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use.
  2.dedicated host can help you address compliance requirement and reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server bound 
    software licenses.
  3.pay for a physical host that is fully dedicated to running you instances, and bring your existing per-socket,per-core,or per-vm
    software licenses to reduce cost.
                                        (can i migrate a dedicated host to another availability zone ---no)

4.spot instances:-
  1.amazon EC2 spot instances let you take advantages of unused EC2 capacity in the AWS cloud spot instances are available at upto 90% 
    discount compared to on-demand prices.
  2.you can use spot instances for test and development workloads.
  3.you also have the options to hibernate,stop or terminate your spot-instances when EC2 reclaims the capacity back with two minutes 
    of notice.

*base points:-1.unused instances that we can bid on them and available at 90% of cost.
              2.used for testing and deployemnt workloads.


 question:-when would my spot instances get interupted?
 ans     :-1.primary reason would be amazon EC2 capacity requirement (eg.on-demand or reserved instances)
           2.secondarily if you have choosed to set a 'max spot price' and the spot price rised above this.

5.schedule instances:-
  1.shedule reserve instances enable you to purchase capacity reservations that recur on a daily,weekly or monthly basis with
    a speciafied state time and duration for a one year term. 
  2.you reserve the capacity in advance so that you know it is available when you need it
  3.you pay for the time that the instances are scheduled , even if you do not use them.
  4.schedule instances are a good choice for workloads that do not run continously but do run on a regulare schedule
  5.purchase instances that are always available on the speciafied recuriing schedule for a one-year term
  6.for eg->you can use schedule instnances for an application that runs during business hours or batch processing run at the end 
    of the week.
  
*base points:-1.we can schedule for daily, weekly, and monthly basis.
              2.we can reserve on advance so that it is available when we need.
              3.it used for workloads that do not run continously but do ran on regular schedule.

6.reserved instances:-
  1.amazon EC2 RI provide a significant discount (upto 75%) comapared to on-demand pricing and provide a capacity reservation when
    used in a specific availability zone.
  2.reserved instances give you the option to reserve a DB instance for a one or three year term and in turn receive a significant
    discount compared to the on-demand instance pricing for the DB instances.

*base points:-1.we can reserved for 1-3 years term
              2.it is 75% discount compared on demand.
              
  3.types of reservd instances 
        1.standard RI 
        2.convertible RI
        3.schedule RI
  
     1.standard RI:-these provide the most significant discount (upto 75% on-demand) and are best suited for steady-state usage.
     2.convertible RI:-these provide a discount (upto 75%) and the capability to change the attributes of the RI as long as the 
                       exchange results in the creation of reserved instances of greater or equal value.
     3.schedule RI:-these are available to launch within the time window you reserve.

**Questions:-
1.can i transfer a convertible or standard RI from one region to another?
==>no 

2.how do i change the configuration of a convertible RI?
==>you can change the configuration of your convertible RI using the EC2 management console or the get reserved instance
   management quata API

3.DO i need to pay a fee when I exchange my convertible RI?
==>no  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EC2 access:-
   
  1.to access instance, you need a key and key pair name.
  2.you can download key pair only onces.
  3.the public key is saved by aws ot match is to the key pair name and private key when you try to login to EC2 instance.
  4.without key pair you cannot access instance.
  5.we can create upto 20 instance per region and also we can create a instance by requesting to aws 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EC2 status check:-
  
  1.by default, aws ec2 service perform automated status checks every one minute 
  2.this is done on every running EC2 instances to identify any hardware or software issue.
  3.status check is build into aws ec2 instance.
  4.they cannot be configured deleted or diasable.
  5.EC2 instance can send its metric data to aws cloudwatch every 5 minutes.
  6.enable detailed monitoring is chargeble and sends metric in every 1 minute.
  7.you are not charged for EC2 instances if they are stopped , however attached EBS volume incure charges.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**When you stop an EBS backed EC2 instance.
   
  1.instances perform a shutdown
  2.state change from running ---- stopping
  3.EBs volume remain attached to instance.
  4.any data cached in ram or instance store volume is gone
  5.instances retains its private IPv4 or any IPv6
  6.instances releases its public IPv4 address back to aws pool.
  7.instance retain its elastic ip address.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EC2 termination:-
  
  1.when you terminate running instances its state changes running --- shutdown ---- terminate
  2.during settling down you do not occur charges.
  3.by default EBS root device volume are deleted automatically 
  4.additionally volume attache to instance by deafult persist after the instance is termianted.
  5.but if we modify the instance by modifying delete on termination tick, volume should not be deleted
  6.enable EC2 termination protection against accidental termination.so that instance should not be terminated.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EC2 metadata:-

  1.it is instance data that you use to configure or manage the instances.
    e.g:- IPV4, IPV6, hostname, security group, nacl, DHCP, instance type, public keys, private keys, DNS.
  2.the metadata we can also view on server when we login with them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EBS (elastic block storage)                               instance storage

 1.most common replicate with A-Z                        1.physically to host server
   we can create a snapshot of a volume
   and replicate/ migrate with different 
   A-Z
2.EBS volume is a availabilty zone specific                
  and snapshot is a region specific.
3.EBS volume are attached at launched and                2.data not lost when os is rebooted.
  deleted when instance termianted.
4.but when we detach a EBS and delete a instance         3.data lost when
  the volume should not be deleted.                         a.underlying drive fails
                                                            b.instance stopped or terminated.
                                                            c.you cant attach or detach to another instance
                                                            d.do not rely on for valuable long term data.

===============================================================================================================================================

**EFS-(elastic file system):-
   1.EFS stands for Elastic File System, which is a scalable and fully-managed file storage service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
   2.It provides a simple and flexible interface for creating and managing file systems, allowing multiple instances to access the same file
     system simultaneously.
   3.With EFS, you can easily store and share files across multiple instances, containers, and serverless functions, without worrying about the
     underlying infrastructure or capacity planning.
   4.EFS automatically scales up or down the storage capacity as per your application needs, and also provides high availability and durability 
     of your data.
   5.EFS supports multiple file access protocols such as NFSv4, which enables you to access your file systems from on-premises or cloud-based
     instances. Additionally, EFS also supports file locking, encryption at rest, and seamless data migration between file systems, making it
     a highly versatile and reliable storage solution for your applications in the AWS cloud.

**practical:-
    1.create a two instances
          1.EFS-01 / EFS-02
          2.give the machine amazon 
          3.select keys-pair
          4.and give the security group like ssh,NFS-anywhere
          5.create a instance
    2.click on EFS
           1.create a file system
           2.vpc-default
           3.regional
           4.next
           5.virtul private cloud -default vpc
           6.there is a sg group default . we can add our sg group
           7.next and create 
    3.access EFS-01
           1.ec2-user
           2.mkdir efs
           3.yum install amazon-efs-utils -y
           4.then go to EFS and attach --mount via DNS
           5.then copy EFS mount helper and paste on the EFS-01
           6.ls
           7.cd efs
           8.touch file file2 file3
           9.ls

    4.access EFS-02
           1.ec2-user
           2.mkdir efs
           3.yum install amazon-efs-utils -y
           4.then go to EFS and attach --mount via DNS
           5.then copy EFS mount helper and paste on the EFS-01
           6.ls
           7.cd efs
           8.ls

=================================================================================================================================

**Elastic IP:-

  1.It is nothing but static ip.
  2.suppose we have to terminate the instance the instance will be permanantly terminated but when we have to stop the 
    instance and next time start the instance the ip will be automatically changes.but we have not to change the ip we can 
    attached elastic ip to a instance then next time you start the machine the ip will not be change.
  3.A Public IP address associated with an instance is not static means when you stop the instance it will automatically
    changes whereas Elastic IP address is a static public address associated with your AWS account.
  4.private ip is remain same in all conditions
  5.all AWS accounts are limited to five Elastic IP addresses per Region.

2)why should we avoid elastic ip:-
   While Elastic IP addresses can be moved between instances, they are still associated with only a single region, and 
   only for use within AWS, so they are not totally flexible.
     
3)How to launch a EC2 instance:-
   1.name---------my-server
   2.select  application o.s image
   3.instance type
   4.key pair-------create a new key pair
   5.network setting------vpc----subnet
   6.inbound security group rules
   7.configure storage
   8.launch instance 
   9.then copy the public ip

  10.open the putty
  11.paste the ip there
  12.then ssh
  13.auhtentification---creadentials
  14.browse---the key you created attach 
  15.open
  16.host the server you have created


4)How to attach a elastic ip----static ip to a EC2 instance:-
   1.go to the elastic ip
   2.allocate elastic ip
   3.then go to action
   4.associate elastic ip address
   5.allocate the elastic ip and you see that when you stop or start the instance the ip will not be change.

=========================================================================================================================

**security group:-
   
   1.it is a virtual firewall works at ENI level.
   2.upto 5 security groups per EC2 instance interface can be applied.
   3.can only have permit rules,cannot have deny rule.
   4.stateful.return traffic,of allowed inbound traffic is allowed,even if there are no rules to allow it.
   5.if you allow port in inbound traffic then you can not attach separate port in outbound traffic the port will be 
     automatically allow both inbound and outbound traffic.

base points:-

   1.it is operate at instance level.
   2.support allows rules only.
   3.stateful,return traffic is automatically allowed.
   4.applies to an instance only

How to attach a security group:-
   1.click on instance
   2.go to security group
   3.edit inbound traffic------add rule  
   4.save

=============================================================================================================================

**EBS(elastic block storage):-

   1.EBS volume behave like ram,Unformatted,external block storage devices that we can attach to our EC2 instance.
   2.EBS vloumes are block storage devices suitable for database style data that requires frequient reads and writes.
   3.EBS volumes are attached to your EC2 instances through the aws network like virtual hard drives.
   4.an EBS volume can attach to a single EC2 instance only at a time.
   5.both EBS volume and EC2 instance must be in the same Availability zone.
   6.it is a persistant storage means if u have to terminate the EC2 instance the data will not be deleted.


1)How to add volume:-
   1.1st create a volume
   2.gp2 
   3.size
   4.ap-south-1
   5.create volume

   6.click on created volume
   7.go to action---attached volume
   9.instance
  10.attched volume  
 
  11.go to instance 
  12.refresh instance
  13.click on instance
  14.check storage---the volume will be attached

  15.then configure with putty
  16.paste the public ip there
  17.ssh----auth---credentials---------browse a file
  18.then create a directory-----------mkdir /pune
  19.then give them a filesystem-------mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf
  20.then mount -----------------------mount /dev/xvdf /pune
  21.df -Th
  22.the partition will be seen 

==================================================================================================================================

**AMI(amazon machine image):-

  1.it is a amazon machine image.
  2.amazon machine image is provided by aws that provides the inforamation required to launch an instance.
  3.it is a template that contents a software information.
  4.from an AMI, you launch an instance, which is a copy of the AMI running as a virtual server in the cloud.
  5.You can launch multiple instances from a single AMI when you require multiple instances with the same configuration.


How to create a AMI(amazon machine image):-
  1.click on instance
  2.go to action--------click on image and template----create template
  3.give a name
  4.launch or create a AMI
 
  5.then click on created AMI
  6.launch a instance from that AMI
  7.the AMI will be default AMI set which you can be created.

==================================================================================================================================

**How to retrive metadata of amazon linux machine:-
   
  1.create a instance
      -name-
      -image-amazon machine image 
      -security group--http,ssh
  2.access the instance in putty
      -ec2-user
      -run the command
        TOKEN=`curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600"` \
        && curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" -v http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
  3.the metadata should be shown and you can the info of these by adding on these after meta-data

==================================================================================================================================

**EC2 LOAD BALANCER:-
  
  a load balancer acts as the traffic cop sitting infront of our server and routing client request accross all server capable of 
  fulfilling those request.

**application load balancer:-
  
  1.an application load balancer makes routing decision at application layer(http,https).
  2.support base path can route a request in one or more port on each container instance in your cluster.
  3.it works on the OSI model layer 7 i.e. called application layer(http,https).
  4.ALB uses target groups to route traffic to EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses.
  5.ALB supports cross-zone load balancing, which means that it can distribute traffic evenly across multiple Availability Zones
  6.ALB uses Elastic IP addresses (EIPs) for its frontend.
  7.ALB supports SSL/TLS offloading, which means that it can terminate SSL/TLS connections and decrypt traffic before forwarding 
    it to the backend.
  8.ALB performs health checks at the application layer to ensure that traffic is sent only to healthy instances.
  9.ALB supports HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket protocols.

**network load balancer:-

  1.an network load balancer makes routing decision at transport layer (tcp).
  2.it can handle millians of request per second.
  3.it works on the OSI model of layer 4 i.e transport layer.
  3.while NLB uses target groups to route traffic to IP addresses and instances.
  4.while NLB does not support cross-zone load balancing.
  5.while NLB uses static IP addresses assigned to the network interface of the load balancer.
  6.while NLB does not support SSL/TLS offloading.
  7.while NLB performs health checks at the transport layer.
  8.while NLB supports TCP, UDP, and TLS protocols.

**classic load balancer:-

===================================================================================================================================

**AUTOSCALING:-
  
  1.it is a service which is provided by aws to autoscale up and scale down the instances based on the demand for your application.
  2.autoscaling helps you save cost by cutting down the number of EC2 instances when not needed and scaling out to add the instances
    when it is required.
  3.it works on the scaling policies that we can attach to the autoscaling group.
  4.When the demand for your application is increases,autoscaling will automatically add the instances to handle the load.
  5.Conversely,when the demand for your application is decreases,autoscaling will automatically remove unnecessary instances to 
    save the cost.
  6.autoscaling in AWS is a powerful feature that can help you optimize your compute resources and improve the performance and
    scalability of your application or service.


**Types of scaling:-
  
   a).Vertical scaling:
       1.With vertical autoscaling,you can add or remove CPU, memory, storage,or other resources to an instance to increase or 
         decrease its capacity.
       2.In other words, it involves adding more resources to an existing instance, rather than adding more instances.
    
   B).Horizontal scaling:-
       1.Horizontal scaling involves adding more instances to a system to handle increased demand or workload.
       2.Horizontal scaling is often used for applications or services that experience high traffic or workload spikes, where 
         additional computing resources are needed to handle the increased demand.
       3.Horizontal scaling can be more cost-effective than vertical scaling (scaling up), as adding additional smaller instances
         is often cheaper than adding more resources to a single larger instance.

====================================================================================================================================

**Difference between launch configuration and launch template:-
 
  1.launch configuration:-1.it is a older format for creating a instance.
                          1.it is a instance configuration template used with autoscaling group to create a instance. 
                          2.it can be associated with multiple ASGs. 
                          3.after creating an instance with the help of launch configuration we can not modify them.
                          4.we have to create new instance and attach to the autoscaling group if any modification is 
                            required.    
                          5.Basic or detailed monitoring for the instances in the ASG can be enabled when a launch 
                            configuration is created.

                                
  2.launch template-----:-1.it is a newer format or more flexible format to create a instance.
                          2.it is a template which is used to launch an instance using EC2 console.
                          3.after creating an instance we can also modify them.
                          4.it enable you to store the ami,instance type,security groups,and key pair etc.so that you do not need to 
                            define these parameters every time when you launch an instance.
                          5.Launch templates allow you to maintain and update your instances in a more efficient way.
                          6.it allows multiple versions of a template to be defined.
                          7.it allows the selection of both Spot and On-Demand Instances or multiple instance types.
                          8.it supports EC2 Dedicated Hosts. Dedicated Hosts are physical servers with EC2 instance 
                            capacity that are dedicated to your use.
                          9.it Supports the multiple instance types and purchase options in a single ASG.
           
    In summary, while both launch configuration and launch template can be used to launch instances in AWS, launch templates offer 
    more advanced customization options, greater flexibility, and easier maintenance and management compared to launch configurations.

**IAM (identity and access management):-
   1.it refers to a framework or policies and technologies for ensuring that the proper people in an organisation have the appropriate 
      access to the technology resources.
   2.AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that provides secure access to AWS resources.
   3.we can use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed-in) and authorised (has permission) to use resources.
   4.It allows you to manage users,groups,and permissions to control who can access which resources in your AWS account. 

**IAM user:-
   1.an IAM user is a resource in IAM that has associated credential and permission.
   2.an IAM user can represent a person or an application that gives its creadentials to make a aws request.

**IAM group:-
   1.an IAM group is an identity that spacify collection of IAM user. 
   2.we can add no of users in a group so that we can spacify permission for multiple user at a same time.
   3.group make permission easier to manage for large set of user.

**IAM role:-
   1.IAM role is an identity in IAM that we create in our own account that have the specific permission.
   1.IAM role in aws works like a IAM user.
   2.it has also a credentils and permission required to access to the aws services in the server.
   4.it can be authenticated and authorized to utilize an aws resources.  

**IAM policies:-
   1.it define permission for an action regardless of that method that you can use to perform the operation.
   2.an policy is an object in AWS where associate with an entity or resources define their permission.


**LIMITATIONS:-
    1.IAM user limit is 5000 per aws account you can add upto 10 users at one time.
    2.you are also limited to 300 groups per aws account.
    3.you are limited to 1000 IAM roles under aws account.
    4.default limit of managed pollicies attached to an IAM role and IAM user is 10.
    5.IAM user can be a member of 10 groups.
    6.we can have two access keys (max) to an IAM user.
  
**FEATURES:-
   1.User Management:
       IAM allows you to create, manage, and delete users in your AWS account. You can also assign individual security credentials, 
       such as access keys and passwords, to these users.

   2.Group Management: 
       IAM allows you to create and manage groups of users in your AWS account. You can assign permissions to these groups and make
       it easier to manage access for multiple users at once.

   3.Policy Management: 
       IAM allows you to create and manage policies that define the permissions for users and groups to access AWS resources. These 
       policies can be used to grant or deny permissions to specific actions or resources.

   4.Multifactor Authentication:
       IAM allows you to require users to authenticate using multiple factors, such as a password and a security token, to provide an 
       extra layer of security.
 
   5.Role-Based Access Control: 
      IAM allows you to create and manage roles that define the permissions for AWS services and resources. This allows you to grant
      temporary access to specific resources to users, without giving them permanent access.

   6.Integration with AWS Services: 
      IAM integrates with other AWS services, such as AWS CloudTrail and AWS Key Management Service, to provide a more comprehensive 
      security solution.

**S3 SERVICE-(simple storage service):-
 
**difference between block storage and object storage:-

1.Block storage:-1.Block storage is suitable for transactional databases,random read/write loads and structured database storage.
                 2.In block storage,the block storage divides the data into a evenly small blocks and then it is stored in a block
                   storage evenly in a sized blocks.a file can be split into a evenly sized blocks before it is stored.
                 3.Data blocks stored in block storage would not contain metadata.
                 4.Block storage only keep the address (index) where the data blocks are stored,it does not care what is in that
                   block just how to retrive it when required.

2.Object storage:-1.Object storage can stores a file whole means it does not divide the file into a blocks.
                  2.In object storage an object is...1.the file/data itselt
                                                     2.its metadata
                                                     3.object global unique ID
                  3.The object global unique ID is a unique identifier for the object (can be the object name itself) and it must 
                    be unique such that it can be retrieved disregarding where its physical storage location is
                  4.Object storage cannot be mounted as a drive.
                  5.example:-dropbox,aws s3,facebook,etc.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bucket versioning:-
   1.Bucket versioning in s3 sub-resources is used to protect the data/object from accidental deletation and overwrites.
   2.versioning can also be used for data retrieve and archieve.
   3.once you enable the versioning on a bucket it cannot be disabled,however it can only be suspended.
   4.when enabled it can protect the existing and newly updated data and maintain their versions as they are updated.
   5.when versioning is enabled and you try to delete an object, a delete marker is placed on the object.
   6.you can still view the deleted object and the delete marker.
   7.if you reconsider deleting the objects,you can delete the "delete marker" and the object will be available again.
   8.you can use versioning with s3 lifecycle policies to delete older version or you can move them to cheaper s3 storage.
   9.versioning applied to all objects in bucket and not partially applied.


**MFA(multi factor authentification):-
   1.multi factor authentification is a versioning capacity that adds extra layer of security in your account. 
   2.this adds another layes of security for the following
       a)changing the bucket versioning state.
       b)permanently delete an object version.
   3.MFA delete requires
       a)your security credentials
       b)the code displayed on an approved physical or s/w based authenticator device.


**replica in s3:-
   1.In Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service), a replica refers to a copy of an object that is stored in a different location than the 
     original object.Replicas are created to provide data redundancy and increase data availability.
   2.When you enable versioning on an S3 bucket, each time an object is modified or deleted, a new version of the object is created.
     By default,each version of the object is stored in the same region as the original object. However, you can configure S3 to 
     automatically replicate the object to a different region or to a different S3 bucket in the same or a different AWS account.
   3.Replication can be configured using the Amazon S3 Replication feature, which allows you to replicate objects in near-real-time.
     Replication is useful for disaster recovery scenarios and for distributing data across multiple regions for faster access by 
     users in different geographic locations.


**static web-hosting:-
   1.Static web hosting in Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) allows you to host a static website in an S3 bucket. A static website
     is a website that is made up of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other static files that are served directly to the browser without any
     server-side processing.
   2.S3 provides static web hosting for simple, low-traffic websites that don't require server-side processing. It is an affordable and
     scalable solution for hosting static websites, and it also provides high availability and durability for your website files.
   3.static web-hosting is a serverless hosting generally developers use these service to host their website serverlessly means without 
     server-side proccessing.it is affordable and scalable solutin for hosting static website and its low traffic website provides high 
     availability and durablility to website.

**S3 multipart upload:-
   1.it is used to upload object in parts.
   2.it can be upload independently and in parallel, in any order.
   3.it is recommended for object sizes of 100MB or larger.
   4.you must use it for object larger than 5GB.
   5.this is done through s3 multipart API.


**S3 bucket naming rules:-
   1.s3 bucket names are globally unique across all regions.
   2.bucket name cannot be change after created.
   3.if a bucket is deleted,its name becomes available again to you or other account to use.  
   4.bucket names must be atleast 3 and no more than 63 characters long.
   5.bucket name are part of URL used to access a bucket.
   6.bucket name must be a series of one or more labels.
   7.bucket name should not be IP address.
   8.each label should start and end with a lowercase lettar or a number.


**S3 bucket objects:-
   1.an object size stored in an S3 bucket can be a byte to 5TB.
   2.each object is stored and retrieve by a unique key (ID or more).
   3.an object in aws s3 is uniquely identified and addressed through
           a)service endpoint
           b)object name
           c)object key
           d)optionly object-version
   4.object stored in s3-bucket in a region will never leave that region unless you specially move them to another region
   5.a owner can give the access to another user to store the files in a bucket.
   6.you can grant s3 bucket/object permission to
           a)individual user
           b)aws account
           c)make resource public
           d)to all authenticate user


**features:-
   1.we can add server side encryption.
   2.we can add also bucket policy but this is a resource based policy.
   3.versioning
   4.static web service
   5.CORS-cross origine access
   6.cross region replication-----high availability.

**CIDR:(classless inter-Domain routing):-
      it is an IP addressing scheme that improves the allocation of IP addresses. It replaces the old system based on classes
  A, B, and C. This scheme also helped greatly extend the life of IPv4 as well as slow the growth of routing tables.


**main reason of CIDR:-  
    The problem would commonly occur when an organization required more than 254 host machines and therefore would no longer fall
    into class C but rather class B. This means that the organization would use a class B license even though they had far less 
    than 65,535 hosts. Therefore if an organization only required 2,500 hosts, they would be wasting about 63,000 hosts by holding
    a class B license which would greatly decrease the availability of IPv4 addresses unnecessarily.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**classes:-

  1.Class A -- Over 16 million host identifiers--- 0-126------(N/8)----N.H.H.H------(N.256.256.256)---256*256*256
  2.Class B -- 65,535 host identifiers------------ 128-191----(N/16)---N.N.H.H------(N.N.256.256)-----256*256
  3.Class C -- 254 host identifiers----------------192-223----(N/24)---N.N.N.H------(N.N.N.256)-------256

**127 is the loopback ip (system IP):-
    1.The IP address range 127.0.0.0/8 is reserved for loopback addresses, which means that any traffic sent to these addresses 
      is looped back to the same device. In other words, the loopback address allows a device to communicate with itself.
    2.The most commonly used loopback address is 127.0.0.1, which is also known as the "localhost." When you type "localhost" 
      into your web browser, it will resolve to 127.0.0.1, and your browser will communicate with your own device's web server.
    3.In summary, the use of the 127 class IP is to provide a loopback address for devices to communicate with themselves, and 
      it is commonly used for testing and debugging network applications.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**How to calculate host:-
 
   1.class A -----subnet mask ---N.H.H.H/8
                         host---=2^24
                                =167777216 hosts (16 million host)

   2.class B -----subnet mask---N.N.H.H/16
                         host--=2^16
                               =65536 hosts
 
   3.class C ----subnet mask----N.N.N.H/24
                        host---=2^8
                               =256 hosts

**subnetting concept:-

*what is subnet
   1.it is a network within a network. 
   2.a subnet is a range of IP addresses in our vpc.
   3.you can attach aws resources such as ec2 instances and RDS instances to subnet.
   4.you can create a subnet to group instances together according to your security and operation needed.
 

*what is switch:-
    with the help of switch we can connect two network within a network with same network IDs.

*what is router:-
    with the help of router we can connect two different networks.

**VPC(virtual private cloud):-

  virtual private cloud is a virtual network that closely resembles a traditional networking that you operate in your own
  datacentre,with the benifits of using the scalable infrastructure of aws.
                                              or
  VPC stands for Virtual Private Cloud. It is a cloud computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows 
  users to create a virtual private network (VPN) in the cloud.

  1.amazon vpc provide logically isolated area from other virtual network in aws cloud where we can launch aws resources
  2.A VPC allows users to define a virtual network topology, including subnets, routing tables, and network gateways, in a 
    private and isolated virtual network within the AWS cloud. 
  3.This allows users to launch and manage resources, such as instances and databases, in a secure and isolated manner.
  4.max 5 vpcs can be created and 200 subnets in 1vpc.
  5.we can allocate max 5 elastic IP.
  6.once we created vpc,DHCP,NACL and security group will be automatically created.
  7.all vpc are isolated to each other.
  8.if you are pearing your vpc to other in that case your and other client have different CIDR block.otherwire they will
    not be pearing with each other.
  9.subnet is availability zone specific.
 10.vpc is region specific.
 11.once a vpc is created,you cannot change its CIDR block range.
 12.if you need different CIDR size,create a new vpc.
 13.the different subents within a vpc cannot overlap.
 14.you can however expand your vpc CIDR by adding new/extra IP address ranges.
 
  Overall, VPCs provide a secure and flexible way to host resources in the cloud while maintaining control over the
  network topology and access to those resources.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TYPES of VPC:-
  
    1.default vpc
    2.custom vpc


A).default vpc:-1.it is created default in each region when an aws account is created.
                2.Has default CIDR,security group,NACL and route table settings.
                3.Has an internet getway default.

B).custom  vpc:-1.it is a vpc on aws account owner creates.
                2.aws user creating the custom vpc can decide the CIDR.
                3.has its own security group,network acl and route tables.
                4.does not have a internet getway by default,one needs to be created if needed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**if you have create a vpc the 4 steps you should follow:-

1.create a vpc (10.0.0.0/18)

2.create a subnet
     a)10.0.0.0/20  ----------public subnet
     b)10.0.16.0/20 ----------public subnet
     c)10.0.32.0/20 ----------private subnet
     d)10.0.48.0/20 ----------private subnet

3.create a internet getway and attach to a vpc

4.create a nat-getway and attach to private route-table
    
5.create a route-table
     a)my-public-route-table
         1.add subnet public subnet
         2.attach iGW
     b)my-private-route-table
         1.add subnet private subnet
         2.attach nat-getway

6.create a instances
     1.bastion-host-server (public server)
     2.my-web-application-1 (private server)

7.login with putty to access private server
     1.vim mayur.pem
     2.chmod 400 mayur.pem
     3.ls -l mayur.pem
     4.ssh -i (key-name)(hostname)@(private ip of private server)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**USE of bastion host-server:-
    1.A bastion host server acts as a gateway to a private network or server that is not directly accessible from the internet.
    2.It provides a single entry point for users who need to access specific resources on the private network.
    3.All inbound traffic to the private network is routed through the bastion host server, which allows administrators
      to control and monitor access to the private network.
    4.It enhances security by restricting access to sensitive systems and data to only authorized users.
    5.It enables organizations to better control user activity and quickly detect and respond to potential security threats.
    6.Using a bastion host server can reduce the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents.
    7.Overall, a bastion host server is an important tool for securing access to private networks and resources.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**components of vpc:-

  A).public subnet:-1.In public subnet the internet getway should be attach.they have known the route of internet getway.
                    2.if a subnet traffic is routed to an internet getway,the subnet is known as public subnet.
                    3.the instance in public subnet can send outbound traffic directly to the internet.
                    4.if you want your instance on public subent to communicate with the internet over IPv4.it must have
                      a public IPv4 address on elastic IP address.    

  B).private subnet:-1.In private subnet the internet getway should not be attached.
                     2.if a subnet does not have a route to internet getway the subnet known as private subnet.
                     3.when you create a vpc,you must specify an IPv4 CIDR block for VPC.
                     4.the allowed block size is between /16 to /24 netmask.
                     5.the first four and last IP address of subnet cannot be assigned.
                     6.the instance in a private subnet can not send outbound traffic directly to the internet.
          
                              1).10.0.0.0 ------------ network address
                              2).10.0.0.1 ------------ reserved by aws for vpc route
                              3).10.0.0.2 ------------ reserved by aws for the IP address of DNS server
                              4).10.0.0.3 ------------ reserved for future use
                              5).10.0.0.255 ---------- brodcast address
                          
                     Note:-aws do not support brodcast in a vpc but reserve this 5 address.
             
                                 =65,536-5           ,    =256-5
                                 =65,531             ,    =251

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
**ROUTE TABLE:-
   
  1.it is a central routing function.
  2.it connects the different availability zone together and connects VPC to internet getway.
  3.you can have upto 200 routes table per vpc 
  4.you can have upto 50 routes entries per route table.
  5.each subnet must be associated with only one route table at any given time.
  6.if you do not specify a subent to route table association,the subnet will be associates with the default VPC route
    table
  7.you can also edit the main route table if you need,but you cannot delete main route table.
  8.however you can make a custom route table manually become the main route table then you can delete the former main,
    as it is no longer a main route table.
  9.you can associate multiple subnets with the same route table.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**what is the purpose of route table:-
  
   1.main purpose of route table is to help routers make effective routing decisions.
   2.whenever a packet is sent through a router to be forwarded to a host on another network,the router consults the 
     routing table to find the IP address of the destination device and the best path to reach it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           
**IMPLIED ROUTES:-
  
  1.it is nothing but the logical routes.
  2.it behaves like logical routes but doesnt exist actually.
  3.but they have the property of VPCs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

**INTERNET GATEWAY:-
  
  1.it is kind of router.
  2.it also a virtual router that connects VPC to a internet.
  3.if you create a new VPC then you must attach the internet getway in order to access internet.
  4.ensure that your subnets route table points to the internet getway.
  5.it performs NAT between your private and public IPv4 address.
  6.it supports both IPv4 and IPv6.
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**NAT GATEWAY:-(network address translation)

  1.you can use network translation getway to enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other 
    aws services.but prevent internet from initialing a connection with those instances.
  2.you are charged for creating and using a NAT gateway in your account NAT gateway hourly usage and data processing 
    rates apply amazon ec2 charges for data transfer also apply
  3.to create a NAT getway you must specify the public subnet in which the NAT gateway should recide.
  4.you must also specify an elastic IP address to associate with NAT getway when you create it.
  5.no need to assign public IP address to your private instance.
  6.after you have created a NAT getway you must update the route table associated with one or more of your private 
    subnets to point internet bound traffic to gateway.this enables instance in your private subnet to communicate with
    internet.
  7.deleting a NAT gateway,disaciciates a elastic IP address but does not release the address from your account.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Lab on nat getway:-

1.create a vpc-----10.0.0.0/18
2.create a subnet
    public subnet----10.0.0.0/20
    private subnet---10.0.16.0/20
3.create a internet getway and attach to vpc
4.create a nat getway
5.create a route table
    public route-----give the public subnet and giving the internet getway
    private route----give the private subnet and giving the nat getway
6.then go to ec2
    1.create a private instance by giving them a private subnet
    2.create a bastion host server by giving them a public subnet
7.then access the bastion host server 
    1.save the pem key
    2.give the ssh to access the private instance
    3.then access the private instance by ssh
      (ssh -i (pem-key name) (machine name)@(private IP of private instance)
    4.then ping 8.8.8.8 to check the internet and its working.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**NAT instance:-


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Lab on nat instance:-

1.create a vpc---10.0.0.0/16
2.create a subnet
    public subnet----10.0.0.0/24
    private subnet---10.0.1.0/24
3.create a internet getway and attach to a vpc
4.create a route table
    public route---add a public subnet and give the internet getway
5.then go to ec2
    1.launch a instance 
    2.search a nat and click on community AMi and select a nat instance
    3.give the vpc and public subnet to route the internet for private instance
    4.giving the security group and add the ssh,http,and all ICMP v4.
    5.then launch the instance
6.then create a private instance
    1.take the amazon machine
    2.select vpc and give the private subnet
    3.attach a security group
    4.launch the instance
7.then access the nat instance
    1.access nat instance
    2.save the pem key (vim mayur.pem)
    3.check also internet is working or not (ping 8.8.8.8)
    4.then give the ssh so that we can access private instance on nat instance
        (ssh -i "mayur.pem" (machine name)@(private ip of private instance)
8.then access private instance
    1.check internet is by ( ping 8.8.8.8 ) and the internet is not working
    2.so go to the route table and when we create a nat instance that time the default route for nat is automatically 
      created.
    3.so click on the route table and click on route and give the nat instance
    4.then check the internet by ( ping 8.8.8.8 ) and the internet is not working
    5.then go to ec2 and click on the nat instance then click on action then click on networking then click on 
      check source/destination check and stop the checking and then save
    6.and then you can check the internet by( ping 8.8.8.8 ) and you can access the internet.
    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**network acl:-
 
  1.it is a function performed on the implied router
  2.NACL is an optional layer of security for your VPC that cuts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one
    or more subnets.
  3.your VPC automatically comes with a  modifiable default network acl by default it allows all inbound and outbound 
    ipv4 traffic and applicable ipv6 traffic.
  4.you can create a custom network acl and associate it with a subent by default,each custom network acl denies all 
    inbound and outbound traffic untill you add rules.
  5.each subnet in your VPC must be associate with a network acl if you dont explicity associate a subnet is automaticaly
    associate with the default network acl
  6.it functions at subnet level.
  7.NACL are stateless,outbound traffic for an allowed inbound traffic,must be explicity allowed too.
  8.you can have permit and deny rules in a nacl.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Lab on network ACL:-

 1.create a vpc-------10.0.0.0/16

 2.create a subnet
       public subnet---10.0.0.0/24

 3.create a internet getway and attach to a vpc

 4.create a route table 
       public route---add subnet association and route on these

 5.creat a network acl
      1.associate a subnet
      2.add inbound permission 
            100---ssh 
      3.add outbound permission 
            100---http 
            200---https
 
 6.then create a ec2 server and access these you can not access the server because of the permission you give in only 
   inbound traffic.you have to give the permission on the outbound also so that you can access the permission
      1.outbound traffic---250--all tcp--1024-65535

 7.then you can access these ec2 server
 
 8.then try to access the internet you cant access the internet because you have only allow outbound traffic so we can also
   add permission on the inbound traffic.
      1.inbound traffic----200---all tcp---1024-65535

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**security group:-
   
   1.it is a virtual firewall works at ENI level.
   2.upto 5 security groups per EC2 instance interface can be applied.
   3.can only have permit rules,cannot have deny rule.
   4.stateful.return traffic,of allowed inbound traffic is allowed,even if there are no rules to allow it.
   5.if you allow port in inbound traffic then you can not attach separate port in outbound traffic the port will be 
     automatically allow both inbound and outbound traffic.

**Base points:-

   1.it is operate at instance level.
   2.support allows rules only.
   3.stateful,return traffic is automatically allowed.
   4.applies to an instance only

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Differentiate between security group and NACL:-

       security group                                        NACL
 
  1.operate at instance level.                 -----    1.operate at subnet level.
  2.support allows rules only.                 -----    2.it permits allow as well as deny rules.
  3.stateful,return traffic is automatically   -----    3.stateless,return traffic must be explicity allowed by 
    allowed.                                              rules.
  4.applies to an instance only.               -----    4.applies to all instance in the subnet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**VPC peering:-

  1.a vpc pearing connection is a networking connection between two vpc that enables you to route traffic between them
    using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 address.
  2.instance in either vpc can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network.
  3.you can create a vpc pearing connection between you own vpc or with a vpc in another aws account.the vpc can be in 
    different region.

**transitive peering:-

  1.Transitive peering refers to the ability for two or more peering partners to exchange routing information with each 
    other and then extend that routing information to other peering partners that they have in common,even if those partners
    do not have a direct peering relationship.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**VPC endpoint:-

   1.A vpc endpoint enables you to privately connect your vpc to supported aws services instance in your vpc do not require
     public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service.
   2.there are two types of vpc enpoints
       a)interface
       b)getway


**Differerence between interface and getway:-

   1.Interface endpoints use an elastic network interface (ENI) as an entry point for traffic to the AWS service, 
     while gateway endpoints use a VPC endpoint gateway.

   2.Interface endpoints are used for services that have a private IP address within the VPC, such as Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB,
     while gateway endpoints are used for services that have a public IP address, such as Amazon Kinesis and Amazon CloudWatch.

   3.Interface endpoints are highly available and scalable,with support for multiple ENIs and multiple IP addresses per ENI,
     while gateway endpoints are typically limited to a single endpoint per VPC.

   4.Interface endpoints are associated with a subnet and require a route table entry to direct traffic to the endpoint,
     while gateway endpoints are associated with a VPC and do not require any additional configuration.

   5.Interface endpoints support endpoint policies, which allow you to control access to the endpoint,
     while gateway endpoints do not support endpoint policies.

   1.create a vpc (10.0.0.0/16)

   2.create a subnet
        a)public subnet (10.0.0.0/24)

   5.then go to chrome and give a username=openvpn
                                  password=(example)
   6.then click on the machine which you created on the webpage then automatically download a file
   7.click on that downloaded file so that file is install on the machine which you are created
   8.and when vpn is install it create a symbol on the desktop so you can click on that icon and connect 
   9.server  ---
     username---openvpn
     password---(example)
 
8.then you can access the private server

**Database:-
    it is a collection of data systematic collection of data but in a organise form called as database.
    databases support storage and manipulation of data.
 eg.facebook,telecom companies,amazon.com

**what is DBMS:-
    it is a collecton of programme which enables its users to access database,manipulate data,reporting/representation of data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**RDBS(relational database service):-part1

   1.it is datastructure that allows you to link information from different tables,or different types of data bucket.
   2.tables are related to each other.
   3.all fields must be filled.
   4.best suited for OLTP (online transaction processing)
   5.relational databases are mysql,oracle DBMS,IBM database
   6.a row of a table is also called record.it contain information fo each individual entry in the table.
   7.a schema is  used to define tables,coloums,index and relation between tables.
   8.relational database are usually used in enterprise application/scenario.
   9.exception mysql which is used for web application.
  10.cannot scale out horizontally.it is a vertically scalable.
  11.virtually all relational DB uses SQL.
  12.scale out means adding instance
  13.scale in means terminate the instances.
   
**steps to create database:-
   1.create a database
   2.flavour------------mariadb
   3.version------------default
   4.template-----------free tier
   5.DB instance--------(give the name)
   6.master name--------(user name)
   7.master passwd------(password)
   8.instance config----db.t3.micro
   9.storage
  10.connectivity-------connect to EC2 instance.
  11.EC2 instance-------(select)
  12.public acceess-----no
  13.create new security group
  14.create database.
                           
  then
  1.create a EC2  
  2.ubuntu
  3.instance storage--t2.micro
  4.add security rule----mysql aurora--3306
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**NOsql or non-relational database:-
  
  1.non-relational database is used to store the data without a structured mechanism to link data from different
    tables to one another.
  2.require low cost hardware.
  3.much faster performance (read/write) compared to relational database.
  4.horizontal scaling is possible.
  5.never provide table with flat fixed coloumn records.it means schema free.  
  6.best suited for online analytical processing.
  7.examples:-NOsql database-mongoDB,casantra,postgreSQL,etc

**types of NOsql databases:-
      1.coloumn database (casantra,HB)
      2.document database (mango DB,raven DB,couch DB)
      3.key-value database (dynamo DB,tokyo cabinet)
      4.graph based database (flock DB,neo4J)

**1.coloumnar database:-
    1.a coloumnar database is a DBMS that store data in coloumn instead of rows.
    2.in a coloumnar database all the coloumn 1 values are physically together followed by all the coloumn 2 values.
    3.benefit is that because a coloumn-based DBMS is self indexing,it uses less disk space that a RDBS containing 
      tha same data.
    4.it easily perform operation like minimum,maximnum and average.
   
**2.documnet database:-
    1.document database make it easier for developers to store and quering data in a DB by using same document model
      format they used in their application code.
    2.document database are efficient for storing catalogue.
    3.store semistructure data as document typically in JSON or XML format.
    4.a document database ia a great choice for contain management application such as blogs and videos platforms.
 
**3.key-values database:-
    1.a key vlaue DB is a simple DB that used an associate array as a fundamental model where each key is associate
      with one and only one value in a collection.
    2.it allows horizontal scaling.
 
**graph basa database:-
    1.a graph base database is basically a collection of nodels and edges each node represent an entity and each edge
      represent a connection or relationship between two nodes. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**RDBS:-part2
    
 In an aws fully managed relational DB engine service where aws is resposible for
   1.security and patching
   2.automated backups
   3.software updates for the DB
   4.if selected,multi-AZ with synchronous replication between the active and standby DB
   5.by default,every DB has weekly maintance window.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**setting managed by user:-
   1.managing DB setting.
   2.creating relational database schema.
   3.database performance tunning.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**relational DB engine options:-
   1.mssql
   2.mysql
   3.oracle
   4.aws aurora---high throughout
   5.postgresql---its highly reliable DB
   6.mariadb------mysql compatible 64TBDB
   7.aurora postgras
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**there are two licensing options:-
   1.BYOL--bring your own license.
   2.license from aws on hourly basis.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**RDS limits:-
   1.upto 40DB instances per account.
   2.10 of this 40 can be oracle or ms-sql server under license included models.
   3.under BYOL model,all 40 can be any DB engines you need.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**RDS instance storage:-
   1.amazon RDS use EBS volumes (not instance store) for DB and logs storage.
       a)general purpose(gp2):-use for DB workloads with moderate input output requirement.
           limit:-1.min-20GB
                  2.max-16000GB

       b)general purpose(gp3):-performance scale independantly from storage
        
       c)provisional IOPS RDS storage:-use for high performance OLTP workloads.
           limit:-1.min-100GB
                  2.max-16000GB
      
       d)magnetic:-limited to maximum of 100 IOPS
       
    OLTP---relational DB uses.
    OLAP---non-relational DB uses. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**template available in RDS:-
    1.production:-use default for high availability and fast,consistent performance.
   
    2.dev/test:-this instance is intended for development use outside of a production environment.
   
    3.free tier:-use free tier to develop new app test existing app or gain hands on exp. with amazon RDS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**DB instance size(classes):-
   1.standard class-(included m class):-
       maximum 96vCPU , 384GB ram , EBS:-14000mbps

   2.memory optimized class-(included r and x):-
       maximum 96vCPU , 768GB ram , EBS:-14000mbps
   
   3.burstable class -(include t classses):-
       maximum 8vcpu , 32GB ram , EBS:-15000mbps

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
**concept of multi AZ in RDS:-
  
**what is multi-AZ in RDS:-
   
   1.we can select multi-AZ option during RDS DB instance launch.
   2.if we not select these option our DB should by stand alone not create stand by DB.
   3.we can create standby to provide high availability and fault tolerance.
   4.if primary DB not work we can access standby.
   5.RDS creates standby instance in different Availability zone but in same region and configure "synchronous replication" 
     between the primary and standby.
   6."sychronous" means if we udpdate any data entry in primary instance these data also update in standby instance called as
      synchronous.
   7.you can not read/write in standby RDS DB instances.only aws can read/write in standby RDS instances.
   8.also we can not choose AZ where we can create a standby DB instances.
   9.we can however view which AZ selected after the standby created.
  10.depending on instance class,it may take 1 to few minutes to failure to the standby instance.
  11.if suppose primary is failure by any reason in that condition our standby instance set as primary,means we can read/write
     the standby instance.
  12.and when the primary instance correct or work properly in that condition our primary instance should be primary and standby
     instance is set to standby mode.
  13.aws recommends the use of provisioned IOPS instances for multi-AZ RDS instances.
  14.why aws recommends provisioned IOPS because it provides high availability and high performance and manages workloads.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**there are two methods to backup and restore our RDS DB instances:-
       1.aws RDS automated backup
       2.use initial manual backup
 
  1.either we can take backup of entire DB instances or just the DB.
  2.we can cr eate a storage volume snapshot of our entire DB instance.
  3.automated backups by aws,backup our DB data to multiple AZ to provide for data durability.
  4.select automated backup in aws console.
  5.stored in amazon s3.
  6.multi-AZ automated backups will taken from the standby instances.
  7.DB instance must be active state for automated backups.
  8.RDS automatically backup the DB daily by creating a storage volume snapshot of our DB instance (fully daily snapshot)
    including the DB transaction logs.
  9.no additional charge for RDS backing up our DB instance.
 10.automated backup are deleted when we delete our RDS DB instances.
 11.AN outrage occurs if we change the backup retention period form zero to non-zero value or other way around.
 12.retention period of automated backup is 7days  (by default) via aws console.
 13.aws aurora is an exception its default is one day.
 14.via CLI or API , 1 day by default.
 15.we can increase it upto 35 days.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**install a webserver on your ec2 and attach a database

1.create  a ec2 server
      1.launch a instance
      2.take a amazon machine
      3.attach a security group and add permissions like ssh,http,https,and mysql/aurora(3306)

2.create a database
      1.mysql database
      2.give the passwd
      3.database name--sample
      4.attach a sg group same that we attach a ec2

3.then access the ec2 server
      1.sudo dnf update -y
      2.sudo dnf install -y httpd php php-mysqli mariadb105

20.then you can attach with the database
   (mysql -h (database endpoint) -u (username) -p
21.then the data should be stored perfectly in the database you can check by accessing these website.
         
=====================================================================================================================================

**Database types:-

 A.unstructured data:-
    1.it is a information that either does not have a pre-defined data model or is not organised in a pre-defined manner.
    2.unstructured information is tipically text heavy but may contain data such as dates,numbers and facts as well examples include
      email message,word proccessing ducuments,video,photos,audiofile,presentation webpages.
    
 B.semi-structured data:-
     1.it is a information that does not reside in a relational database but that does have some oraganisational properties that make
       it easier to analyse eg.XML,JSON.
    
 C.structured data:-
     1.it is a data which is stored in database ina structured form that inclusion a relational database.
     2.they have a relational key and can be easily mapped into pre-defined field.

**DynamoDB table:-
     1.a table is a collection of data items.
     2.like all other DB,dynamodb stores data in tables.
 
**Items:-
     1.each table contains multiple items.
     2.An item,is a group of attributes that is uniquely identifiable among all of the other items.
     3.an item consit of a primary or composite key and a flexible not of attributes.

**Attributes:-
     1.each item is composed of one or more attributes.
     2.an attributes consist of all attribute name and a value of a set of value.
     
   note:-aggregate size of an item cannot exceed 400KB including key and all attributes.

**Dynamodb:-
  1.dynamodb allows  low latency read/write access to items ranging from 1 byte to 400KB.
  2.dynamodb can be used to store pointer to s3 stored objects,or items of sizes larger than 400KB too if needed.
  3.dynamodb stores data index by a primary key
     1.you specify the primary key when you create the table.
     2.each item in the table has a unique identifier or primary key,that distinguisher the item from all of the others in the table.
  4.the primary key is only required attributes for items in a table. 
  5.dynamodb tables are schemaless.
  6.which means that neither the attributes nor their data types need to be defined beforehead.
  7.each item can have its own distinct attributes.

**dynamodb-read/capacity unit:-
  1.one read capacity unit requires one strongly consistent read per second or two eventually consistent reads per second for item
    upto 4KB in size.
  2.if you need to read an item that is larger tha 4KB,dynamoDB will need be consume additional read capacity units.
  3.the total number of read capacity units required depends on item size,and whether depends on item size,and whether you want an 
    eventually consistent or strongly consistent read.
  
**write capacity unit:-
  1.one write capacity unit represents one write per second for an item upto 1KB in size.
  2.if oyu need to write an item that is larger than 1KB.dynamodb will nedd to consume additional write capacity unit.
  3.the total no of write capacity unit required depends on the item size.

**DynamoDB DB unit:-
  1.256 tables per account per region.
  2.no limits on the size of any table.

======================================================================================================================================

**SNS-(simple notification service):-
   1.SNS stands for Simple Notification Service and it is a messaging service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
   2.SNS enables you to send messages or notifications from the cloud to various subscribed endpoints, such as email addresses,
     HTTP endpoints,mobile devices, and more.
   3.You can use SNS to decouple the components of your application by sending messages between them in a reliable and scalable way. 
   4.For example, you can use SNS to send notifications to your users when a new product is added to your online store or when an  
     error occurs in your application.
   5.Overall, SNS provides a simple and cost-effective way to send messages between distributed systems, microservices, and serverless 
     applications running on AWS.
   6.sns is a fast,flexible and fully managed push notification service.
   7.it is a webservice that coordinates and manages the delivery or sending of message to subscribing endpoints or clients.
   
======================================================================================================================================

**SQS-(simple queue service):-
   1.it works on the pull mechamism.
   2.sqs is a fast,reliable and fully managed message queue service.
   3.it is a webservice that gives you access to message queue that store message waiting to be processed.
   4.it offers reliable,highly scalable,hosted queue for storing messages between servers.
   5.Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
   6.It enables you to send, store, and receive messages between different software components or distributed systems.
   7.In simple terms, SQS allows you to decouple the components of your application so they can run independently, without being
     tightly coupled together.
   8.This can help to improve the reliability and scalability of your application by isolating different components and ensuring
     that they can operate independently of each other.
   9.With SQS, you can send messages between different parts of your application, or even between different applications, without 
     worrying about the reliability of the underlying network or infrastructure. 
  10.SQS stores your messages in a distributed queue, making them highly available and durable, so you can be sure that your messages
     are safe and won't be lost.  

**types of SQS:-
   1.standard queue 
   2.FIFO queue
 
*standard queue:-
  1.high throughout
  2.at least one delivery
  3.duplicacys is possible
  4.best effort ordering.
  
*FIFO queue:-
  1.limited throughout
  2.exactly one processing
  3.duplicacy is non possible
  4.strict ordering
  5.FIFO are limited to 300 transaction per second (TPS).

**steps to create que:-
      1.create a queue
      2.standard queue
      3.name---------------mysqstopic
      4.access policy-----basic
      5.create queue
     
      6.subscribe to amazon SNS topic
      7.send and receive message
      9.create a message "hello everyone"
     10.delivery delay-5S
     11.send message
     12.poll for message
     13.click on link
     14.done.

========================================================================================================================================

**cloud trail:-
   1.it can continously log our aws account activity.
   2.cloudTrail provides a record of the actions taken by a user, role, or AWS service in your AWS account, including actions taken 
     through the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), and AWS SDKs and APIs. 
   3.CloudTrail captures a log of the API calls made to AWS services, which can be used for security analysis, resource change tracking,
     and compliance auditing.
   4.When CloudTrail is enabled, AWS automatically delivers a log file containing the recorded events to an S3 bucket that you specify.
     You can then use this log file to view and analyze the events in your AWS account. 
   5.With this information, you can determine who made a specific API call and when it was made.

=========================================================================================================================================

**cloud formation:-
  1.it is a webserice which is provided by the amazon aws to automate the creation and managing the aws resources using templates.
  2.A template is a JSON or YAML formatted text file that describes the AWS resources and their properties that you want to create.
  3.You can use templates to create resources like EC2 instances, S3 buckets, RDS databases, load balancers, and more.
  4.CloudFormation allows you to manage your infrastructure as code, which means you can version,test,and deploy your infrastructure in a
    repeatable and consistent manner.
  5.You can create, update, and delete stacks of resources using the AWS CloudFormation console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs.
  6.By using CloudFormation, you can save time and reduce errors by creating manually instances or other services.
  7.cloud formation is a service which we can used to setup a infrastructure. 

============================================================================================================================================

**Elastic benstalk:-
  1.it is a platform as a service which is provided by aws that automates the creation of webapplications.
  1.Elastic Beanstalk is a fully managed service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that simplifies the deployment and management of web
    applications. Elastic Beanstalk automates the deployment, scaling, and monitoring of applications in an Amazon Web Services (AWS)
    environment.
  2.Elastic Beanstalk provides a platform for developers to deploy their applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. 
  3.It supports several programming languages such as Java, .NET, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Node.js.
  4.Elastic Beanstalk also integrates with other AWS services such as Amazon RDS, Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon Simple Notification 
    Service (SNS), makin g it easy to create complex applications that use multiple services.
  5.In summary, Elastic Beanstalk is a cloud platform that allows developers to easily deploy and manage their web applications without the 
    need to manage the underlying infrastructure.because it is a platform as a service model.

=============================================================================================================================================

**AWS lambda:-
   1.it is a serverless computing.
   2.it is compute service which we can use to run our code without provisioning and managing the servers.
   3.with aws lambda,you can run your code for virtually any type of application or backed service all with zero administration.
   4.With AWS Lambda, you only pay for the compute time that you consume, which makes it a cost-effective solution for building scalable 
     applications.
   5.Additionally, AWS Lambda supports a variety of programming languages, making it easy for developers to write their code in the language
     they are most comfortable with.
   6.aws lambda run our code on a high availability compute infrastructure.
   7.aws lambda execute our code when needed and scales automatically from a few request per day to thousands per request.
   8.we can pay only when our code run.no charge can apply when the code is not running.
   9.all you need to do only supply your code to lambda in the form of one or more lambda function.
  10.lambda supports the languages like node JS,python,go,rubby,c#,java,powershell,provided Runtime API (custom runtime).
  11.AWS Lambda is often used to build serverless applications, which are applications that run in the cloud without requiring 
     the developer to manage the underlying infrastructure.


**How lambda works:-
    1.first you upload your code to lambda in one or more function.
    2.then lambda excutes the code 
    3.after the code is envoked,lambda automatically take care of provisioning and managing required servers.
  

 **difference between aws lambda and aws EC2
   
                aws lambda                                                                 aws EC2
   1.it is platform as a service model.                                        1.it is a infrastructure as a service model
   2.it supports only limited languagres like java,python                      2.it has no environment so we can run the code on any
     ruby,powershell,c#,node JS,go,runtine API                                   languages.
   3.in lambda,write the code and push the code into AWS                       3.firstly you have to choose the OS and then install the
     lambda.                                                                     software required and then push your code into EC2
   4.you cannot log into compute instance choose customized                    4.you can select variety of OS,instance types,networks and
     os or language platform.                                                    security patches,etc
   5.pay only when our code runs mean pay only for compute                     5.5.pay-per-second bill
     services that we consume.

**Route 53:-
   1.amazon route 53 is a highly scalable and available DNS.
   2.route 53 connect users request to internet application running on aws.
   3.you can use route 53 to register new domains,transfer existing domains,route traffic for your domains to your aws and external resources
     and monitor the health of your request.
   
**DNS:-(domain name system):-
   1.it resolve name to IP.
   2.and resolve also ip to name.

**Route 53 function:-
   1.DNS management
   2.traffic management
   3.availability monitoring
   4.domain registration

**Route 53 performs three major functions:-
   1.register a domain
   2.as a DNS,it routes internet traffic to the resource for your domain.
   3.check the health of your resource.
      1.route 53 sends automated request over the internet to a resorce to verify that the server reachable,functional,available.
      2.also you can choose to receive notification when a resource becomes unavailable and choose to route internet traffic away 
        from unhealthy resources.

**AWS supports domain:-
   1.generic top level domain:-
      (.com , .in , .org , .net)
  
   2.geographic top level domain:-
      (.CN,.IN,.UK,.PK)

**registraing a domain with route 53:-
   1.you can register a domain with route 53 if the top level domain included in the supported Top level domain list.
   2.if the TLD is not included,you can't register the domain with route 53.

**Route 53 hosted zone:-
   1.it is collection of records for a specified domain.
   2.you create a hosted zone for a domain,and then you create records to tell the domain name system how you want traffic to be
     routed for that domain.
   3.basically a hosted zone is a container that hold information about how you want to route traffic for a domain and its subdomain.
   4.you create a public hosted zone or private hosted zone.
   5.for each public hosted zone amazon aws route 53 automatic create a nameserver,record,and a start of authority (SOA) record.
     amazon recommends dont change these record.
   6.route 53 automatically creates a name server record with same name as your hosted zone.
   7.you can create a more than one hosted zone with same name and add different routes to each hosted zone.
   8.route 53 assigns four name servers to every hosted zone.
   9.the name server are different from each of them.


**route 53 default entries for hosted zone:-
   1.nameserver entry:-
      contains the unique sets of name server for this hosted zone.
   2.SOA entry:-
      contains information about the hosted zone.


**Routing policies:-
   1.simple routing (default)
   2.failure routing
   3.geolocation routing
   4.multivalue routing
   5.latency based routing
   6.weighed routing
   7.geoproximity routing


**failover routing:-
   1.failover routing lets you route traffic to a resource when the resource is healthy.if the main resource is not healthy
     then route traffic to a different resource.
   2.the primary and secondary records can route traffic to anything from an amazon s3 bucket that is configured as a website to a 
     complex tree of records.
   3.failover routing policy is applicable for public hosted zone only.

**geolocation routing:-
   1.geolocation routing lets you choose the resource that serves your traffic based on the geographic location of your users i.e the
     location that DNS queries original form.
   2.for e.g. you may have presence in europe asia now you want users in the asia to be served in the asia and those in europe to be 
     served in europe.
   3.BENIFITS:-1.you can localize your content and present some or all of your website in the language of your users.
               2.you can specify geographic locations by continent,by country or by state in the united states.


**latency based routing:-
   1.if your application is hosted in multiple amazon EC2 regions,you can improve performance for your users by serving their respose
     from amazon EC2 region that provide the lowest latency.
   2.to use latency based routing,you create latency record for your resource in multiple EC2 regions.
   3.when amazon route 53 reciever a DNS query for your domain or subdomain.
      1.it determines which amazon EC2 region you have created latency record for
      2.determines which region gives lowest latency to users.
      3.then select a latency record for that region.
   4.you create a latency record for each region.

**weighted routing policy:-
   1.weighted routing policy lets you all multiple resorce with a single domainname or subdomain name,and choose how much traffic is 
     routed to each resouce.
   2.this can be useful for variety of purpose including load balancing,testing new versions of software.
   3.weights can be assign any number from 1 to 255.
   4.to configure weighted routing you create records that have same name and type for each or your resource.

**geoproximity routing policy:-
   1.use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your resorces and optionally shift traffic from resource in one
     location to resource in another.
  
**multivalue answer routing policy:-
   1.use when you want route 53 to respond to DNS queries with upto eight healthy record selected at random.

**cloudfront**
   1.it is a webservice that speed up distribution of your static and dynamic web content such as html,css,java,and image files of your 
     user.
   2.cloudfront deliverd your content through a worldwide network of datacentre called edgelocation.
   3.when a user request content that you are serving with cloudfront the request is route to edge location that provide low latency so 
     that content is delivered with the best possible performance.
   4.amazon cloudfront is content delivery network that securly delivered data video,app to user with low latency and high speed transfer 
     network of global edge location.
   5.if the content is already in the edge location with the lowest latency,cloudfront delivers it immediatly.
   6.this dramatically reduces the number of networks that your users request must pass through which improves performance.
   7.if not cloudfront retrieves it from an amazon s3 bucket or an http webserver that you have identified as the source for the definative 
     version of your content (origin server).
   8.cloudfront also keeps persistent connection with origin servers so files are fetched from the origin as quickly as possible.

**you can access amazon cloudfront in the following ways:-
   1.AWS management
   2.AWS SDKs
   3.cloudfront API
   4.AWS command line interface

**cloudfront EDGE location:-
   1.edge location are not tied to availability zones or regions.
   2.amazon cloudfront has 216 point of presence (205 edge locations and 11 regional edge caches) in 84 cities accross 42 countries.
 
**cloudfront-Regional edge cache:- 
   1.amazon cloudfront has added several regional edge cache locations globally,at close proximity to your viewers.
   2.they are located between your origin webserver and the global edge locations that serve content directly to your viewers.
   3.As object become less popular,individual edge locations may remove those object to make room for more popular content.
   4.regional edge cache working as a alternative of origin to reduce the burden of origin.
   5.regional edge cache have a large cache width than any individual edge location,so object remain in the cache longer at the nearest
     regional edge caches.
 
**cloudfront regional edge cache-working:-
   1.when a viewer makes a request on your website or through your application,DNS routes the request to the cloudfront edge location that
     can best serve the users request.
   2.this location is typically the nearest cloudfront edge location in terms of latency.
   3.In the edge location,cloudfront checks its cache for the requested files.
   4.if the files are in the cache,cloudfront returns them to the user.
   5.if the files are not in the cache,the edge server go to the nearest regional edge cache to fetch the object.
   6.regional edge caches have feature parity  with edge locations for eg. a cache invalidation request remove an object from both edge 
     caches and regional edge caches before it expires.
   7.the next time a viewer request the object,cloudfront returns to the origin to fetch the latest version of the object.

**Practical:-
   1.create a s3 bucket,add object in that bucket and give them a public access.
   2.go to the cloudfront and create a distribution.
        1.origin name=====>select s3 bucket
        2.name============>automatic
        3.origin access===>public
        4.viewer policy===>HTTP/HTTPS
        5.allowed HTTP====>GET,HEAD
        6.create a distribution
  3.then copy the domain name and paste in the new tab
  4.also copy the file name which we can add in s3 bucket.
       
          https://domainame/object name

                  or

    1.create a s3 bucket and add css template in s3 bucket
    2.then create a static web hosting and give them a public access 
    3.go to cloudfront 
        1.create a distribution
        2.origin name----paste static web hosting url
        3.name-----------automatic 
        4.origin access--public 
        5.viewer policy--http/https
        6.create a distribution
    4.then copy the domain name of cloudfront
 
          https://domainame
