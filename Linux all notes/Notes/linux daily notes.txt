NOTES ON LINUX

{handmade notes by mayur}
=======================================================================================================================================================================

OS:- 
1.An OS is the intermediate layer between the hardware and the user.
2.It manages hardware resources like CPU, memory, storage, and I/O devices.
3.it works like a interpreter
4.Example tasks: running programs, file management, memory allocation, and process management.

HARDWARE:-
hardware basically a tangential component or physical component of any electronic device that can store the data and runs the written code provided by the software. examples: CPU, RAM, HDD/SSD, GPU, etc.

SOFTWARE:-
1.software is a set of instructions or collection of programs that tells the computer how to perform a particular task.
2.Two types:
   System Software – Helps run hardware and OS (e.g., Linux, Windows).
   Application Software – Performs specific tasks for the user (e.g., Chrome, Word).

FIRMWARE:-
1.firmware is a set of instructions or programs written in a machine language which are used to operate the hardware.
2.Example: BIOS, embedded software in devices.

TYPES 0F OS:-
1.desktop machine:- Used for general purposes like presentations, games, and office work.
2.server machine:- whenever the multiple users works on the same website at a same time it doesn't affects the users performance because of the system to be created like these called as server machine.

DEVELOPMENT OF OS:-
1.Single-user single-tasking → MS-DOS--------Only one user can run one task at a time.
2.Single-user multi-tasking → Windows 10-----One user can run multiple tasks simultaneously.
3.Multi-user multi-tasking → Linux/Unix -----Multiple users can run multiple tasks at the same time.

VIRTUAL MACHINE:-
 A virtual machine is an emulation of a computer system that uses the logical resources of a physical computer to run in an isolated and independent environment.
                            or
a virtual machine is a logical resource of physical hardware that runs in an independent and isolated environment.

FEATURES OF LINUX:-
1.free to use
2.Secure and stable
3.light weight
4.open source
5.community-based support
6.multiuser-multitask

1.linux is a kernel not the os
2.linux is not a unix derivative.it was written from scratch

{ Linux kernel + GNU =====> Linux OS }

=======================================================================================================================================================================

VIRTUALIZATION:-

virtualization is a technique of splitting the physical resources into as many as logical resources as needed.
                       				 OR
virtualization is a technology that transform hardware into the software.

HYPERVISOR:-
1.Hyervisor is a software that creates the space and runs the virtual machine. 
2.we use two operating system at a same time with the help of hypervisor.
   
TYPES OF HYPERVISOR:-
1.type-1 hypervisor (bare metal hypervisor)
2.type-2 hypervisor (hosted hypervisor)

TYPE-1 HYPERVISOR (bare-metal hypervisor) ====>>
1.Type-1 hypervisor is also called as bare-metal hypervisor. and also known as firmware.
2.its a hypervisor that directly runs on the host hardware. also known as hardware level virtualization
3.a guest os runs on another level above the hypervisor.
4.Type-1 hypervisor acts as their own operating system.
5.it has the direct access to the host hardware and resources.
6.more secure than type-2
7.example:- (Hyper-V, VMware ESXi)

Architecture:-

Hardware ========> Hypervisor =========> VM ========> O.S =========> centos/ubuntu/windows


TYPE-2 HYPERVISOR (Hosted hypervisor) ====>>
1.type-2 hypervisor is also called as hosted hypervisor.
2.its a hypervisor that runs on the host O.S. also known as os-level virtulization.
3.it does not have the direct access to the host hardware and resources.
4.less secure ( if there is any error in the hardware or the O.S then the whole VMs can crash )
3.example:- (oracle VirtualBox, workstation)

Architecture:-

Hardware ========> Host O.S ========> Hypervisor =======> VM =========> O.S ==========> ubuntu/centos/windows

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MIGRATION =====>>>
    migration is the technique of moving a virtual machine from one host to another host or from one datastore to another datastore.

Types of migration:-
1.cold migration
2.vmotion (Live Migration)
3.suspended migration 
4.physical to virtual (P2V)
5.virtual to virtual (V2V)

Cold migration:-
1.The virtual machine move from one host to another host in powered-off state.
2.so the chances of failure in the cold migration is less than the other migration technique.

Suspended migration:-
1.migrating the virtual machine that is in suspended state/paused state.
2.VM can resume from the same point later.

Vmotion:-
1.Migrates a VM that is powered on.
2.it is also known as live migration.
3.No downtime for the VM.

Physical to Virtual (P2V):-
1.Converts a physical machine into a virtual machine.

Virtual to Virtual (V2V):-
1.Similar to P2V, but the source machine is already virtual.

=======================================================================================================================================================================

DIFFRENCE BETWEEN THE WINDOWS-UNIX-LINUX

Windows
1.windows generally a proprietary based platform where we have to purchase the licence
2.its a paid means we have to purchase before it use
3.its less secure because of the permissions like read write and execute that have all the access in the windows
4.it have also the heavy hardware because whenever we install os in these it gives more space to install
5.its a easy to use because of the GUI based (graphical user interface)
6.it is 80% on desktop
7.it also the non portable as well the close source means we cant change the source code

Unix
1.unix basically also the proprietary based means the licence is required to use
2.its paid we have to purchase before it use
3.its a more secure because of the permission (read write execute) we have manually adjust these permission.
4.its a less heavy hardware to install the os
5.it is 90% on approx. server
6.its a cli based means the command line interface
7.heavy to use because of the cli based
8.closed source means source code cant be changed

Linux
1.its a community based means licence should not be required to use
2.it a free of cost means we don't have purchase to used it
3.it is more secure because we can manually adjust the read write and execute permission.
4.it is open source means we change the source code.
5.it is 90% on approx. server
6.its a cli based means the it is heavy to use.
7.its have the less heavy hardware to install the os it needs basically very less space.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LINUX:-
   Linux is a free and open source operating system that provides the features like stability, security, flexibility, free of cost and it supports the wide range of hardwares.

HYPERVISOR:-
 1.hypervisor basically the software that creates the space and the runs the virtual machine.
 2.we use two operating system at a same time with the help of hypervisor.

INTERPRETER:-
  it reads and executes the program line by line, showing errors instantly

COMPILER:-
  It translates the entire program into machine code first, then runs it faster.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HISTORY OF LINUX:-

1.in 1983 American software engineer Richard Stallman started the project like GNU means the “GNU’s Not Unix.”
2.Then in 1985: The Free Software Foundation (FSF) was established to support the development of free and open-source software.
3.By 1991: Many GNU components like the compiler, debugger, shell, and text editor were developed.
4.But GNU is hard to develop then in 1991 the Finnish software engineer Linus Torvalds develop the kernel.

Note:-
It means GNU is similar to Unix but completely free and open-source, not the original Unix itself.

Linux distributions:-
1.fedora
2.ubuntu
3.redhat

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ARCHITECTURE OF THE OS ===>

User
  |
  V
Shell / Terminal
  |
  V
Linux Kernel (OS)
  |
  V
Hardware (CPU, RAM, Disk, etc.)


1.Hardware:- 
    it is a tangential component or physical component of the computer that can stores the data and runs the written code provided by the software.

2.kernal:- 
   it is a core part of the operating system and has the complete control over everything in the system. its a main layer between the os and the underlying hardware and helps with the tasks such as process and memory management.

3.shell:- 
   shell basically a Linux command line interpreter provides an interface between the kernel and the user and executes the programmes called as shell.it gives input from the user and also take output to the user from kernel

Types of shells in linux
1.bash
2.ksh
3.zsh
4.tcsh

4.applications:-the actual layer where we interact

5.user:- the end user level where the user should be work

=======================================================================================================================================================================

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ROOT-USER AND LOCAL-USER

root user:-
1.root user is a super user in the system
2.it has all the permission in the system
3.it has the home directory {/root}

local user:-
1.local user is a local user in the system
2.local user has the home directory {/home/username}
3.we can create multiple local users in the system.
4.it has the specific permissions in the system.

[root@localhost~]#$ ---------------(prompt)

root---------super user
localhost----hostname
~------------home directory
$------------login with the local user
#------------login with the root user
/------------root directory

*forward slash---------used in the Linux
*backward slash--------used in the windows

for zooming the terminal--------> ctrl shift ++
for zoom out the terminal-------> ctrl --

To switch user:-
 GUI to CLI---------> ctrl+alt+f2 ---> init 3
 CLI to GUI---------> ctrl+alt+f1 ---> init 5

To switch user:-
 from root to local user---- {su - username}
 from local to root user-----{su - root} or {su -}

Difference between the / and the /root
/root------> home directory of root user
/----------> root directory (folder)

=======================================================================================================================================================================

[root@localhost~]# -----------its a root user--home directory---/root

=======================================================================================================================================================================

FILE COPY PROTOCOLS:-

SCP (secure copy protocol):-
 1.its a secure copy protocol that helps us to copy the files from the local to server and from server to local
 2.it is used for transferring the hole file means transfer the file one time

1.To Transfer File From local to Server:-
  scp -i id_rsa file.txt ubuntu@<public_ip>:/home/ubuntu

2.To Transfer File From local to Server:-
  scp-i id_rsa ubuntu@>public_ip>:/home/ubuntu/file.txt Desktop

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RSYNC:-
 1.rsync is used to transfer and synchronize files/directories between local to server, server to server & server to local
 2.it can copy the hole file for 1st time then it can copy only the changes from the file
 3.it works on the ssh which is basically used in the production automation

1.To Transfer File From local to Server:-
  rsync -avz -e "ssh -i id_rsa" file.txt ubuntu@<public_ip>:/home/ubuntu/

2.To Transfer File From local to Server:-
  rsync -avz -e "ssh -i id_rsa" ubuntu@<public_ip>:/home/ubuntu/file.txt ~/Desktop/

-a ---> archive mode
-v ---> verbos
-z ---> compress file during transfer
-e ---> specify remote shell

=======================================================================================================================================================================

NETWORKING COMMANDS:-

1.ping --------------> to check the connection
2.netstat------------> to check the network status (active connections)
3.ifconfig ----------> to check the ip addresses
4.traceroute---------> Show path packets take to a destination.
5.tracepath----------> Simpler alternative to traceroute.
6.mtr----------------> Combination of ping + traceroute (continuous).
7.nslookup ----------> Query DNS records.
8.ip ----------------> Modern replacement for ipconfig.
9.iwconfig ----------> to view or configure Wi-Fi (wireless) network
10.ss ---------------> Modern replacement for netstat.
11.whois ------------> A command used to get information about a domain name, IP address, or an ASN (Autonomous System Number).
12.ifplugstatus------> Check if network cable/interface is connected.
13.curl and jq ------> Fetch data from a web API with curl and format/filter the JSON output using jq. (curl localhost | jq)
14.watch ------------> Run a command repeatedly (live updates).
15.htop--------------> Interactive process viewer (like top, but better)

=======================================================================================================================================================================

COMMANDS TO CHECK PORT BUSY OR NOT:-

1.netstat -tulpn | grep :80
2.netstat -putan | grep :80
3.ss -tulpn | grep :80
4.lsof -i :80

=======================================================================================================================================================================

HOW TO SWITCH VERSIONS USING COMMANDS ===>>>

1.sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk -y
2.sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y

# if suppose i have two versions 17 and 11. i want to shift from 11 to 17 then...

1.Check installed Java versions
  update-java-alternatives --list

2.Switch from Java 11 → Java 17
  sudo update-alternatives --config java ----------> { Select java-17-openjdk from the list }
  
3.Check the current version
  java --version

=======================================================================================================================================================================

commands to learn ====>>>

grep -------> search
sed --------> edit/replace
awk --------> extract/format
find -------> To find file 
locate -----> find file in db

1. awk → Process and extract columns from text

Print entire file:
awk '{print}' file.txt

Print first column:
awk '{print $1}' file.txt

Print first & third column:
awk '{print $1, $3}' file.txt

Print lines where column 3 > 100:
awk '$3 > 100 {print $0}' file.txt

Use with delimiter (e.g., CSV with commas):
awk -F, '{print $1,$2}' data.csv

--------------------------------------------------------------------

2. sed → Stream editor (find & replace, delete, modify text)

Replace first occurrence of "cat" with "dog":
sed 's/cat/dog/' file.txt

Replace all occurrences:
sed 's/cat/dog/g' file.txt

Replace in file (in-place):
sed -i 's/cat/dog/g' file.txt

Delete line 5:
sed '5d' file.txt

Delete lines 2 to 4:
sed '2,4d' file.txt

--------------------------------------------------------------------

3. grep → Search text patterns in files

Search for a word in a file:
grep "error" logfile.txt

Case-insensitive search:
grep -i "error" logfile.txt

Show line numbers:
grep -n "error" logfile.txt

Recursive search in directory:
grep -r "error" /var/log/

Show number of lines:

======================================================================================================================================================================

HOW TO SET THE LINE NUMBERS IN THE FILES:-

1st METHOD:- (Temporary)

1.vim /etc/passwd
  :set nu

------------------------------------------------------------

2nd METHOD:-(Permanent)

1.vim .vimrc
  set nu

2.vim /etc/passwd
  { you get the line nu for every line }

------------------------------------------------------------

Note:-

1.when u set the .vimrc file for root it only works in the root not on local user
2.but when u set the .vimrc file in local then it works in the local 

But...
1.if we set the globally in the /etc/vimrc then it works on both root & local user

======================================================================================================================================================================

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE .bashrc & /etc/bashrc

1..bashrc ---> ( User-specific configuration )
  whenever we change in the file it will replicate to only local user or root user while login

2./etc/bashrc ---> ( System-wide configuration )
  whenever we change in the file it will replicate to all the users in the system include your local users and the root users while login

Example:-
1.vim .bashrc
  echo -e "\n😈 ROOT MODE ACTIVATED"
  echo -e "⚡ Type carefully...\n"

2.source .bashrc

{ when you login with local user u get these message }

=======================================================================================================================================================================

WHAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE .bashrc / crontab / at / .vimrc

1..bashrc
    it will print text on the terminal when u open the terminal

2.crontab 
    it can print on the terminal but on a schedule time means perform the repeated task

3.at 
    it also print on the terminal but on a fix time or one time only 

4..vimrc
    it can only show messages into the file whenever u open the file

=======================================================================================================================================================================

TO PRINT TEXT WHILE BOOTING

1.vim /etc/rc.local

#!/bin/bash
echo "🚀 Welcome Mayur! System is booting successfully 🚀" > /dev/tty1
exit 0

Note:-
Message must be before exit 0
Use /dev/tty1 so it appears on the boot screen

2.chmod +x /etc/rc.local

3.systemctl enable rc-local
4.systemctl start rc-local

5.sudo reboot
  You should see your message during boot

=======================================================================================================================================================================

HOW TO COPY LINES FROM ONE FILE TO ANOTHER FILE

1.touch sample.txt

2.vim /etc/passwd

4yy -------------------------> #To copy 4 lines from file

:edit /root/sample.txt

p ---------------------------> #To paste the lines on sample file

:wq

3.cat sample.txt

=======================================================================================================================================================================

HOW TO REPLACE WORD WITH ANOTHER WORD IN FILE (Vim)

# Replace the word root with mayur in /etc/passwd

1.vim /etc/passwd

:%s/root/mayur/g 

2.wq!

3.cat /etc/passwd

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:s/root/mayur/    ------> Replace first occurrence in current line 
:s/root/mayur/g   ------> Replace all occurrences in current line  
:1s/root/mayur/g  ------> Replace in line 1 only                   
:1,10s/root/mayur/g ----> Replace from line 1 to 10                
:%s/root/mayur/gc ------> Replace with confirmation (recommended)  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LINUX FILE-SYSTEM SECURITY

how u define security:- security basically the permissions that we given to the files folder or anything in the system.

{ drwxrwxrwx 3 root root 8188 jul 1 8:31 file1 }

explanation:-
  d------------------file type
  rwx----------------permissions
  3------------------link count
  root---------------ownership
  8188---------------size
  jul----------------date and time
  file1--------------file name

1.FILE TYPE:-

User define files
  1.normal file (-)
  2.directory   (d)
  3.link file   (l)

System define files
  4.socket device file (s)
  5.character device file (c)
  6.pipe file (p)
  7.block device file (b)

=======================================================================================================================================================================

3. LINK COUNT:- (ln)

  1.file-------------------(1)
  2.directory--------------(2)
  3.parent directory-------(3)

What are links:-
  links are nothing but the connection between the file name and the actual data on the disk. We call it as the shortcuts.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

TYPES OF LINKS:-

HARDLINK:- (ln)  
1.to create a backup a file basically use hardlink
2.link count increases by 1
3.inode number is same (ls -i)
4.cannnot create hardlink of directory
5.if u write anything on the original it will copy to the hardlink file
6.its file type is normal file.

example:-
ln file1 file2

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SOFTLINK:- (ln -s)
1.to create a shortcut file used softlink
2.link count does not increases
3.inode number is different (ls -i)
4.can create softlink of file as well as directory
5.if u delete the softlink file its colour changes to red from blue
6.its file type is link file.

example:-
   ln -s file1 file2 

Metadata:-(data of data)
  The data that provide the information about the other data but not the content of that data.

command:-
ln -------------to create the hardlink
ln -s ----------to create the softlink
ls -i ----------to get the inode number
ls -in ---------to get the inode with the file name

=======================================================================================================================================================================

4.OWNERSHIP:-
    ownership means basically who owns the file and the group of that file 

1.To change owner:-
chown Linux file

2.To change the group:-
chgrp Linux file

3.To change both owner and group:-
chown Linux:linux file

example:-
1.touch new
  ls -l
2.chown Linux:linux new
  ls -l

=======================================================================================================================================================================

2.PERMISSIONS:-

owner------>rwx
group------>rwx
other------>rwx

  1.r------>read (4)

Read (r)-------------> ls (long listing) 
Write (w)------------> create, delete, edit, remove
execute (x)----------> change directory, command, script, app binary files

In binary form:-
rwx-------->111
r-x-------->101
rw--------->110
r-- ------->100
-w- ------->010
--x ------->001

-----------------------

UMASK:- umask gives making values of default user/permissions

ROOT :- 022
Local:- 002

calculate for ROOT user:-
For file:-
umask = full permissions - default permissions
      = 666 - 644
      = 022

For dir:-
      = 777 - 755
      = 022

calculate for LOCAL user:-
For file
umask = full permissions - default permissions
      = 666 - 664
      = 002

For dir:-
      = 777 - 775
      = 002


command to change umask:-
Temporary:-
  umask (value)

permanent:-
 1.vim /etc/profile ------------> file
    else
    umask 022
 2.source /etc/profile ---------> to update the file

-----------------------

To change the permissions:-

   u---------> user
   g---------> group
   o---------> other

(+) -----------> add the permission
(-) -----------> remove the permission

SPECIAL PERMISSIONS

   1.suid (super user identification permission)
   2.sgid (super user group permission)
   3.sticky bit permission
   4.sudo permission
   5.acl permission

1.SUID (super user identification permission)
    it is defined as giving permission to a user to run a file program with the permission of file owner means all users get access of executable files.

{ note:- if a root user command not accessible by local users but if i add the SUID permission to the command all the users can access these command }

===>How to apply SUID
     { chmod u+s (command) }
===>How to remove SUID
     { chmod u-s (command) }

example:-
  1.chmod u+s /sbin/dmidecode
  2.ls -l /sbin/dmidecode
  3.rws r-x r-x

=======================================================================================================================================================================

2.SGID (super user group permission)

1.This permission can inherent the group property means the group of parent directory inherit with the child directory and files.
2.SGID (Set Group ID) is a special permission in Linux that makes files or directories inherit the group ownership of the parent — not the user who created or runs it

inherit ===> means when we assign group to a directory/file then all the users in the group can access the directory/files

===> How to apply sgid
     { chmod g+s "directory/file name" }

===> How to remove sgid
     { chmod g-s "directory/file name" }

Example:-

1.create a group
groupadd cloudblitz
gpasswd cloudblitz

2.add users into the group
gpasswd -M user1,user2 cloudblitz

3.to check the group
tail /etc/group

4.to create directory
mkdir /project
ls -ld /project
rwx r-x r-x -----------default permissions

5.to remove the others permissions
chmod 770 /project
ls -ld /project
rwx rwx --- -----------new permissions

6.add cloudblitz to the /project
chgrp cloudblitz /project
ls -ld /project
rwx rwx ---  root cloudblitz ----------adding group to the /project file

7.to add sgid to a /project file
chmod g+s /project
ls -ld /project
rwx rws --------root cloudblitz ------s denotes their is a execution permission

8.to create file in /project
su - user1
cd /project
touch file1

9.to create file in /project with user2
su - user2
cd /project
touch file2

summary:-
1.first i have create the group and add users into the group
2.then i have created the project file and remove the other permissions from that file
3.after that i have add the cloudblitz group into the project file
4.but for inheriting the group i have assign the sgid permission
5.finally after that i have switch the users into the project file and creating the multiple files 

drawback:
1.But all users from the cloudblitz can access all the files from the project file thats why we are adding the sticky bit permission 

=======================================================================================================================================================================

3. STICKY-BIT permission

    1.this permission basically used for controlling all the users to resist the delete and modify operation.
    2.only the owner and the root user have to access to delete or modifies the file.

===>how to apply the sticky bit permission
    { chmod o+t "file name" }

===>how to remove the sticky bit permission
    { chmod o-t "file name" }

example:

1.applying the sticky bit permission
  chmod o+t /project
  ls -ld /project
  rwx rwx --T 

note:-
T-------------> there is not execution permission
t-------------> there is a execution permission

4.ACL (access control list permission)
    it is a special type of permission that adding extra permission to a user to use these directory and also denies all other users to use that directory.

In short:-
1.particular user high access
2.particular user deny access

-------------------------------------------

commands:-

1.how to apply acl for a user
  { setfacl -m u:mayur:rwx /project }

2.how to apply acl for a group
  { setfacl -m g:cloudblitz:rwx /project }

3.how to deny other user permission
  { setfacl -m u:mayur /project }

4.how to remove the acl permission
  { setfacl -x u:mayur /project }
  { setfacl -x g:cloudblitz /project}

5.how to remove all the acl
  { setfacl -b /project }

6.how to check the acl
  { getfacl /project }

-------------------------------------------

example: 

How to apply acl to a user ====>>

1.useradd mayur
passwd mayur


2.mkdir /project
ls -ld /project
rwx r-x r-x

3.setfacl -m u:mayur:rwx /project

4.getfacl /project
mayur:rwx

5.create a file in /project
su - mayur
cd /project
touch file

{ note:- before applying acl mayur user can not create the file because there is no write permission mayur user can only list and execute the file }

------------------------------------------

How to deny the another user permission====>>

1.useradd Shubham
passwd Shubham

2.setfacl -m u:shubham /project

3.getfacl /project
mayur:rwx
Shubham:...

4.su - shubham
cd /project
touch file
permission denied

------------------------------------------

How to apply acl to group====>>

1.groupadd cloudblitz
gpasswd cloudblitz

2.useradd mayur
useradd shubham

3.gpasswd -M mayur,shubham cloudblitz

4.setfacl -m g:cloudblitz:rwx /project

5.getfacl /project
cloudblitz:rwx

6.su - mayur
cd /project
touch file

7.su - shubham
cd /project
touch file2

------------------------------------------

How to remove acl of group===>
setfacl -x g:cloudblitz /project

How to remove acl of user===>
setfacl -x u:mayur /project

How to remove all the acl from directory
{ setfacl -b /project }

------------------------------------------

how to check the acl on any file/directory:-

when u see the (+) sign on the other permission section.

------------------------------------------

how to get backup of a file:-

cp /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.bkp

=======================================================================================================================================================================

4.SUDO (super user do permission)
   it allows you to temporarily elevate your current user account into root privilege means we can use root user command as a local user 

configuration file ==>
1.vim /etc/sudoers 
2.visudo 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1st technique to do permission with password:-

1.vim /etc/sudoers
  write below the root user
  Linux      ALL:(ALL)    /sbin/dmidecode  -----------> format to write
  wq!

2.su - Linux
  sudo dmidecode
  warning generated (do not use sudo command only for root user)
  type the passwd
  access
  
3.if i access with other user to check 
  su - mayur
  sudo dmiddecode
  mayur is not in the sudoers file. This incident will be recorded

{ Note: if the other use the sudo file the mail should be automatically generated send it to the root user }

4.to check the mail
  vim /var/spool/mail/root

5.to check the mail direct
  mail

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

2nd technique to do permission without password:-

1.vim /etc/sudoers
  type the prompt below the (same thing without password)
  Linux          ALL:(ALL)          NOPASSWD:/sbin/dmidecode
  wq!

2.then switch the user
  su - Linux
  sudo dmidecode
  access

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

3rd technique to add the user in wheel group:-

1.add user into the wheel group
  cat /etc/group
  gpasswd -a Linux wheel
  cat /etc/group

2.switch the user
  su - Linux
  sudo dmidecode
  sudo shutdown (all the root user command)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

4th technique to do permission with wheel group in /etc/sudoers file

1.vim /etc/sudoers
  check the wheel group (/wheel)
  edit all---->/sbin/dmidecode

=======================================================================================================================================================================

FILTER AND SEARCH UTILITY===>

FILTER:-

GREP:-

1.to find out the words
grep "root" file1

2.to show the no of that line
grep -n "root" file1

3.to show how many lines
grep -c "root" file1

4.for extended words
grep -E "rootforany" file1

5.to show either capital or small
grep -i "root" file1

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SEARCH:- to search a particular file/directory

1.locate:- can find a file in database system
  updatedb:- can update the file in database

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIND:- to find out file and related information

syntax:
 { find (path) (options) (attributes) }

examples:-

1.find / -name mayur
2.find / -user mayur -type d 


example:-

1.find / -user mayur 

if we have to copy all the related data of a user:-
   1.mkdir /backup
   2.find / -user mayur -exec cp -rvf '{}' /backup\:

but this command change the ownership we have not change the ownership
   1.find / -user mayur -exec cp -aprvf '{}' /backup\:

=======================================================================================================================================================================

ARCHIEVING

Tar:- it is used for creating, compressing the achieves files and also maintain and modify them.

example:-

1.tar -cvf /mnt/etc.tar /etc -------------to create
2.ls /mnt/
  etc.tar
3.du -sh /mnt/etc.tar --------------------to check the file size
  38mb      etc.tar
4.tar -tvf /mnt/etc.tar ------------------to check the compress files 
5.tar -xvf /mnt/etc.tar -C /mnt ----------to extract the files
6.ls /mnt/
  etc etc.tar
7.du -sh /mnt/etc
  43mb   etc  


Note:-
c--------->create
v--------->verbos
f--------->file name
C--------->change directory
x--------->extract
du -sh --->to check the file size

2.yum provides head ---------------> to check which package provides the head command
3.yum reinstall coreutils ---------> reinstall the coreutils so that head command should download
4.head anaconda -------------------> to check the command

=======================================================================================================================================================================

difference between "yum remove" and "yum autoremove"

1.yum remove = Removes package only.
2.yum autoremove = Removes package + unnecessary dependencies installed with it.


*permanent setup to remove package with dependencies:
1.vim /etc/yum.conf ---------------configuratioin file

day 31 32 33 of Linux

PARTITION:-
  separation of disk into multiple parts.

1.volatile memory:-(temporary memory)
   its a temporary memory means the data stored in a ram for a specific time.(ex.ram)

2.non-volatile memory:-(permanent memory)
   its a permanent memory means the data stored in a disk for a permanent purpose.(ex.rom)

3.why we create the partition:-
   1.partition makes the backing up easier.
   2.separating the user data from the system data.
   3.allows use of different filesystem to be installed for different kinds of files.

4.sata:-
    the data stored in a serial format.

5.pata:-
    the data stored in a paragraph format.

6.filesystem:-
    1.its a proper configuration of storing the metadata.
    2.it uses the metadata to store and retrieve the files.

---------------------------------------------------------

How to add disk:-

  1.go to setting
  2.storage ------> select sata -------> choose hard disk
  3.create new
  4.select virtual hard disk (VHD)
  5.dynamically allocated
  6.then storage-------attached VHD
  7.create partition of 8gb

---------------------------------------------------------

*There are three steps:-
    1.create a partition
    2.assing the filesystem
    3.mount the partition

---------------------------------------------------------

1.create the partition of sdb
   1.fdisk /dev/sdb
   2.press n for create -----n
   3.select default (P)------enter
   4.partition no (P)--------1
   5.first sector (default)--enter
   6.last sector------------ +2Gb
   7.w---------------------- for save

   2.press n for create -----n
   3.select default (P)------enter
   4.partition no (P)--------2
   5.first sector (default)--enter
   6.last sector------------ +2Gb
   7.w---------------------- for save

   8.lsblk ----------------- to check the partition
   9.partprobe-------------- to update the partition table

2.assign the filesystem
   1.mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb2
   2.blkid ------------------ to check the filesystem

3.mounting (temporary mount)
   1.mount /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb2 /mnt
   2.df -Th---------------- to check the mount
   3.umount /mnt ---------- to unmount 

4.mounting (permanent mount)
   1.vim /etc/fstab
     /dev/sdb1    /mnt       ext4      defaults    0  0
     /dev/sdb2    /mnt       ext4      defaults    0  0
   2.lsblk  -------------- to check the partition
   3.df -Th -------------- to check the mount after giving the filesystem

--------------------------------------------------------------

How to delete the partition:-

1.fdisk /dev/sdb
  press m for help---------m
  press d for delete-------d
  partition number---------2
  partition is deleted
  w------------------------save

--------------------------------------------------------------

Difference between the (lsblk) and (df -Th):-

1.lsblk ----> to list the blocks 
2.df -Th ---> to check the filesystem mount or not

--------------------------------------------------------------

commands:-

lsblk---------------->to check the partition
blkid---------------->to check the filesystem
df -Th/lsblk--------->to check mount 
partprobe------------>to update the partition table

--------------------------------------------------------------

To change the system partition type to Linux lvm:-

1.fdisk -l ---------------to check the partition type
2.fdisk /dev/sdb
  press m for options-----m
  press t ----------------change partition system id
  partition number--------1
  press L list codes------L
  type the code-----------8e
  w-----------------------to save

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LOGICAL VOLUMES:- { merged / extend / reduced / rename / remove }

    We use Logical Volumes (LVM) because normal partitions are fixed in size and cannot be easily extended, reduced, merged, renamed, or removed. LVM allows flexible disk management with these operations.

THREE STEPS TO CREATE A LOGICAL VOLUME:-
1.physical volume (pvcreate)
2.volume group    (vgcreate)
3.logical volume  (lvcreate)

1st METHOD TO MERGED:-

1.create the physical volume
  pvcreate /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb2
  pvs
  pvdisply

2.create the volume group
  vgcreate vg /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb2
  vgs
  vgdisplay

3.create the logical volume
  lvcreate -L +2G -n lv vg
  lvs
  lvdisplay

4.give them filesystem
  mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg/lv
  blkid

5.To mount 
  mount /dev/vg/lv /mnt
  lsblk
  df -Th
 
6.to unmount 
  umount /mnt

--------------------------------------------------------------

2nd METHOD TO EXTEND:-

why we extend the volume:-
  to create the multiple logical volumes as well as if suppose the logical volume is full and we have to add the storage then that time we extended logical volume.

1.to create one more partition
   fdisk /dev/sdb
   press partition nu------P
   last sector ------------(+1G)
  
   change the file type
   partition number-------t
   hex code---------------8e(Linux lvm)
   w----------------------save

2.partprobe -------------- to update the partition table

3.create the physical volume
  pvcreate /dev/sdb3
  pvs

4.extend the volume group
  vgextend vg /dev/sdb3
  vgs

5.extend the logical volume
  lvextend -L +500M /dev/vg/lv
  lvs

6.Then mount 
  mount /dev/vg/lv /mnt

How many partitions we created ======>

MBR partition:-
1.Primary partitions: maximum 4 (including extended).
2.Extended partition: maximum 1 (but optional).
3.Logical partitions inside extended: many (Linux typically supports up to 15 per disk with MBR).

GPT partition:-
we create upto 128 partitions

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Differentiate between the MBR and GPT

🟢 MBR (Master Boot Record)
1.Supports up to 4 primary partitions only.
2.Works with disks of size up to 2 TB.
3.Stores partition and boot data in the first sector of the disk.
4.Older technology, used in BIOS-based systems.

🔵 GPT (GUID Partition Table)
1.Supports 128 partitions (no limit like MBR).
2.Works with disks of size larger than 2 TB.
3.Stores multiple copies of partition data for backup and recovery.
4.Newer technology, used in UEFI-based systems.

=======================================================================================================================================================================

SWAP MEMORY:-
  When the amount of physical ram is full and the system needs the more memory resources and the ram is full then the inactive pages in the memory move to swap space.

Note:-
1.ram <=2GB ---------- swap=2*ram size
2.ram >=2GB ---------- swap=2+ram size

example:-
1.create a partition
  fdisk /dev/sdb
  press n for create-----n
  partition no-----------1
  w----------------------save

2.change the partition type to swap memory
  fdisk /dev/sdb
  press t for change ------ t
  hex code----------------- 82(swap solarius)
  w-------------------------save

3.partprobe --------------to update the partition table
4.lsblk

5.give the filesystem
  mkswap /dev/sdb1
  blkid -----------------to check the filesystem

6.free -h ----------------to check the memory

7.swapon /dev/sdb1
  free -h

8.swapoff /dev/sdb1
  free -h

=======================================================================================================================================================================

RAM (Random Access Memory):
1.Temporary memory – data is lost when power is off.
2.Stores data and programs currently in use.
3.Can be read and written easily.
4.Very fast in speed but limited in size.

ROM (Read Only Memory):
1.Permanent memory – data remains even without power.
2.Stores important instructions for starting the computer.
3.Normally only read, not written to.
4.Slower than RAM but more reliable for permanent storage.

Difference between the public ip and the private ip

 Public IP
   1.Assigned by Internet Service Provider (ISP).
   2.Globally unique (no two devices on the internet can have the same public IP).
   3.Routable on the internet (can communicate directly over the internet).
   4.Often comes with extra cost (paid service).

 Private IP
   1.Assigned by system admin / router / DHCP inside the LAN.
   2.Locally unique only (can be repeated in different networks).
   3.Not routable on the internet directly (requires NAT to communicate outside).
   4.Free of cost (anyone can use private IP ranges).

PORT FORWARDING:-
   it reduces the chances of the hacking also enhance the security by forwarding the port that's why we use port forwarding.

difference between the TCP and UDP

       TCP                                    UDP
1.reliable delivery                    1.unreliable delivery
2.uses 3 way handshake for connection  2.no 3 way handshake, connectionless
3.sending large size data              3.sending minimum size packets
4.tcp is slow                          4.udp is fast
5.http, ssh                            5.dhcp, dns

TCP = Reliable, connection-oriented, slow, used for big data.
UDP = Unreliable, connectionless, fast, used for small packets.

IMPORTANT NOTES:-
 
1.If you change a port, always allow that port in the firewall.
2.If a service is accessed from a client machine, make sure the service port is allowed in the firewall.
3.If you change any configuration file, always restart the service.
4.After downloading or installing any package, you must start the service.

SSH ====> (secure shell protocol)

  1.ssh is a secure shell protocol or network communication protocol that enables the two computer to interconnect
  2.it is a cryptographic protocol or a operating networking service securely over unsecure network.

There are two ways to get ssh:-
1.password based authentication
2.key-based authentication

----------------------------------------------------

1.PASSWORD-BASED AUTHENTIFICATION

In centos Machine====>
1.ssh root@172.25.0.4 -------------> give server machine ip to access and also password
2.passwd:-
3.touch file1

In server machine====>
1.ls
  file1

---------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:-

1.connect server ---> client
  ssh mayur@192.168.0.6

2.and connect client ----> server
  ssh mayur@192.168.0.4

and if not then its a enforcing mode problem try to check
1.getenforce
   enforcing
2.setenforce 0
   permissive

And then connect

---------------------------------------------------------------

2.KEY-BASED AUTHENTIFICATION (with local user)
   
    In key-based authentication there are two keys created (id_rsa, id_rsa.pub)

IN SERVER MACHINE===>(172.25.0.4)

1.creating the user
  1.useradd mayur
  2.passwd mayur

3.Creating the keys (id_rsa id_rsa.pub)
  1.ssh-keygen
    keys created in /home/mayur/.ssh/
  2.cd .ssh/
  3.ls 
    id_rsa id_rsa.pub

4.create a authorized key and give the permission 600
  1.cat id_rsa.pub > authorized_keys
  2.chmod 600 authorized_keys

5.copy the private key in centos machine (scp source destination)
  scp id_rsa mayur@172.25.0.6:/home/mayur/keys

IN CLIENT MACHINE=====>(172.25.0.6)

6.get ssh of server machine
  cd /home/mayur/keys
  ssh -i id_rsa mayur@172.25.0.4

3.ssh root@172.25.0.6
  ls .ssh/

4.ssh -i id_rsa root@172.25.0.6 ----------> get access of clone server

5.if u get error of permission denied
  { check:- vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    #permitlogin ----> provibitate ----> change to permitlogin-----> yes

*************************************************************************

IF WE CHANGE THE PORT:-

IN SERVER MACHINE====>

1.To change the port
   vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

PROCESS MAANAGEMENET:-

    It is a process of running executable programme. whenever the executable programme is in running state called as process.

------------------------------------------------------------------

**There are two type of process:-

1.shell jobs:- the jobs which we create

2.daemon jobs:- the jobs which are running in the background (crond,sshd,etc)

------------------------------------------------------------------

**States of processes:-

1.running process:- (R) (foreground proc)
2.stopped process:- (T)
3.sleep process:-   (S) (interuptable)
4.sleep process:-   (D) (uninterruptable)
5.zombie process:-  (Z) (the process which is killed but still shows it is present)

------------------------------------------------------------------

**To check the process ID:-

1.ps -aux
2.ps -elf
3.Top
4.htop

---------------------------------------------------------------------

**modes stop/terminate/save:-

1.ctrl + z-------> stop
2.ctrl + c-------> terminate
3.ctrl + d ------> save

---------------------------------------------------------------------

**There are two types of jobs to run process:-

1.background process---(bg)
2.foreground process---(fg)


example:-

Background:-

1.sleep 455 &----------------to create job
2.jobs
  1    stopped    sleep 455
3.bg 1 ---------------------stopped to running state
4.jobs
  1    running    sleep 455

Forground:-

1.jobs
  1    running    sleep 455
2.fg 1 -------------------running to stopped
3.jobs
  1    stopped     sleep 455

---------------------------------------------------------------------

pid (1) ----> systemd ------> demon service manages (systemctl)

---------------------------------------------------------------------

**Renice value:-**
   1.To set the priority for the process
   2.it ranges from -20 to 19

Example:-
1.ps -elf | grep sleep
2.renice -n 10 -p 2876
3.ps -elf | grep sleep
   priority change---> 80 to 90

---------------------------------------------------------------------

**Subset**:-

1.S
2.ss
3.SN          N------low priority
4.S<          <------highest priority
5.R+          + -----forground process
6.S+

------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO KILL JOBS:-

1.TOP:- basically used for live monitoring (refresh on every 2 second)

2.load average:-  0.05        0.89        2.33

                every min  every 5 min  every 15 min

Example:-
1.top k (pid) --------------> to kill the job
2.q-------------------------> to quit the job

---------------------------------------------------------------------

1.pkill (process name)

2.kill -9 (PID)

3.kill -l --------> to get all the signal related to the kill command

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Difference between the ps -elf / ps -aux / top command:-

1.ps -elf

ps → process status
-e → show all processes (system-wide).
-l → show in long format (extra details like priority, parent PID, flags).
-f → show in full format (UID, PPID, start time, command).

{so ps -elf = all processes + full \& long format (very detailed, good for admins)}


2. ps -aux
a → show processes of all users.
u → show processes with a user-oriented format (owner, CPU%, MEM%).
x → show processes not attached to a terminal (like daemons).

{So, ps -aux = all processes (including background) with CPU/memory usage and owner.}


3. top
   1.Real-time, dynamic view of running processes.
   2.Continuously updates CPU, memory usage, load average, and top processes.
   3.Interactive (you can sort, kill processes, etc. using keys).

**{ Unlike ps (static snapshot), top is live monitoring.}**



✅ In short:

ps -elf ----> Very detailed, static snapshot (admin-level info).

ps -aux ----> User-friendly, static snapshot (with CPU%, MEM%).

top --------> Real-time, interactive process monitoring.

 							          LOG MANAGEMENT

LOG MANAGEMENT:-

   1.its a record of recent activities, recent events or notification. 
   2.Log management is the process of collecting, storing, and analyzing system-generated records (logs) to monitor activities, troubleshoot issues, and ensure 
     security.

1.ls /var/log----------------> to see the logs
2.ls /var/log/httpd ---------> to see the httpd logs
3.ls /var/log/yum.log--------> to see the yum logs

*****************************************************************

To see the logs:-
1.rsyslog:-
     its a demon service of which it can stores all the logs from the system as well as the remote logs.

2.journalctl:-
      its not a demon service so it can not stores the log it can show all the logs from the boot

3.systemctl:-
    to see the latest logs

4.mesage:-
    to see all the logs of journalctl

*****************************************************************

THERE ARE 8 TYPES OF LOGS WITH PRIORITY:-

1.emergency log-------> (0)
2.alert log    -------> (1)
3.critical log -------> (2)

LOG ROTATION:-

   log rotation is a process of automatically rotating the logs, compressing the logs, deleting, moving, renaming the logs that are too big and too old and stored the new incoming logs into a new fresh file.
  we can rotate the logs monthly, weekly, daily depending upon their sizes.


1.vim /etc/logrotate.d/sample.txt
  /root/sample/*.log {
  weekly

BOOT PROCCESS:- 
   it is a process which is started when we power on the computer or the system and it involves loading and initializing the operating system and the other software necessary for the computer to function properly.

The booting process in Linux involves several stages:-

1.BIOS ----------> 1.bios is a basic input and output system which is the 1st programme executed when the system is on
                   2.it performs POST- means the power on self test
                   3.it checks the peripheral component of the computer whether it is in working state or not
                   4.it stores in read-only memory on the motherboard
  
2.Boot loader ----> boot loader is the 1st programme which is loaded by the bios and searches the kernel to load into the memory

3.Kernal ---------> it is a core part of the operating system that initializes hardware and launches the system services

4.init process --> it is the 1st process which is started by the kernel and initialises the system by starting services and daemons

5.Runlevels -----> it is state of system that determines which services and daemons are start at boot time.

***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************

**RUNLEVELS:-**

init 0-----------> halt the system
init 1-----------> single user mode (special admin)

STORAGE

There are three types of storage:-
1.DAS ------> direct attach storage (pendrive etc)
2.NAS ------> network attach storage (Samba, nfs)
3.SAN ------> storage area network (ISCSI,RAID)

1.SAMBA ====> it basically supports the cross platform and its a file server that enables the file sharing across different operating system over a network

conf file-----> { /etc/samba/smb.conf }

NFS -----> NETWORK FILE SYSTEM

1.it is a network file system that allows the system to share the directories and files with others over the network.
2.it is a mechanism for storing files on a network

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SAMBA AND THE NFS

	Samba						           NFS
1.it supports the cross-platform         	 1.it does not supports the cross-platform
2.integrate with its own authentication 	 2.intergrate with the authentication services like Kerberos, LDAP
3.it has two service ( smb and nmb)		 3.it has also three service ( nfs, mountd, rpc-bind )
4.port number ( smb-445 and nmb-139 )		 4.port number 2049
5.Provides file & printer sharing.		 5.Provides fast file sharing only (no printer sharing).
6.Slightly slower (more overhead).		 6.Faster on Linux/Unix due to lightweight protocol.

=======================================================================================================================================================================

DHCP:- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

1.it automatically assign the IPs to the client
2.it works on the DORA process.
2.its based on client-server model
3.DHCP is an Application Layer protocol.
4.dhcp ip address range is called scope
5.It works over UDP ports 67 (server) & 68 (client).

DHCP SERVER CAN PROVIDE ====>

1.IP address
2.subnet mask
3.domain name
4.default gateway
5.DNS server address
6.Wins server address
          

IT WORKS ON THE DORA'S PROCESS =====>>>

Discover –----> The client broadcasts a request asking “Is there any DHCP server available to give me an IP?”
Offer –-------> The DHCP server replies with an offer (IP address + subnet mask + gateway + DNS info).
Request ------> The client sends back a request saying “I want to use this IP, please confirm.”
Acknowledge --> The DHCP server confirms and leases the IP to the client.

Configuration file====> { /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf }

=======================================================================================================================================================================

DNS SERVER :- (Domain Name System) ====>>>

1.it can translates the domain name into the ip addresses. so computers can locate and communicate with each other on the internet.
2.Without DNS, we have to remember numbers instead of names to open websites.
3.it works on the application layer.
4.top level domains are-->(.com,.org,.biz,.edu,.net,.mil)
5.it works on the port number tcp/udp 53

1.resolve name to ips ---------> forward lookup
2.resolve ips to name ---------> reverse lookup


PRACTICAL:

1.INSTALL THE PACKAGES
  yum install httpd -y
  yum install bind bind-utils
  systemctl start httpd
  systemctl start named

2.ADD INTO THE FIREWALL
  firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent
  firewall-cmd --add-service=dns --permanent
  firewall-cmd --reload

3.CHECK THE IP
  ifconfig ----> 192.168.0.4

4.EDIT THE /etc/named.conf FILE

  add the ip into the options line
  listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; 192.168.0.4; };

  create the zone-block after the zone-block
  zone "mayur.com" IN {
         type master;
         file "mayur.com.fzone";
         allow-query { any; };
  };

5.CHECK THE FILE CORRECT OR NOT

7.CHECK THE FILE CORRECT OR NOT
  named-checkzone mayur.com mayur.com.fzone

8.RESTART THE SERVICE
  systemctl restart named

9.CHECK THE DOMAIN
  nslookup www.google.com
  nslookup www.mayur.com

10.RESOLVE THE ISSUE IN /etc/resolve.conf
   vim /etc/resolve.conf
   nameserver 192.168.0.4

nslookup www.google.com
nslookup www.mayur.com

11.CHECK ON THE FIRE-FOX
   www.mayur.com


NOTE:-
IF U WANT TO CHECK IT ON THE WINDOWS-BROWSER
  1.enable the http port
  2.enable the bridge network
  3.also change the dns from default to our ip
    { control panel ---> network and internet -----> network and sharing centre-----> change adapter setting 
      right click on your network connection, select properties, then select internet protocol version 4(TCP/UDP)

NGINX--> REVERSE PROXY-LOAD BALANCING CONCEPT:-

Client ---> Nginx (Reverse Proxy & Load Balancer) ---> Apache-1
                                           └---------> Apache-2 

“We use Nginx as a reverse proxy to provide security, caching, and load balancing. Instead of clients directly hitting the backend servers, all requests go through Nginx. Nginx then forwards the request to one of the Apache servers and returns the response back to the client. This hides the backend servers, improves performance, and balances traffic efficiently.”

=======================================================================================================================================================================

PRACTICAL-1: - NGINX-REVERSE PROXY

concept:
  1.Website is running on Apache (httpd)
  2.Website should NOT be accessed directly
  3.All users must access it through NGINX reverse proxy
  4.NGINX will take the request → send it to Apache → send response back
  5.So user never touches Apache server directly.
  6.NGINX stands in front as a gatekeeper.

User → NGINX (port 80) → Apache (port 8080) → Actual website

PRACTICAL:-

INSTALL AND SETUP APACHE	

1.yum install httpd -y
2.systemctl start httpd
3.systemctl enable httpd
4.echo "Hello Apache" > /var/www/html/index.html

  listen 8080
7.systemctl restart httpd
8.firewall-cmd --add-port=8080/tcp --permanent

SSL / TLS / HTTPS


ssl -----> secure socket layer
tls -----> transport layer security
https ---> hyper text transport protocol secure

HTTPS = HTTP + TLS ====>>> Secure website

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHY WE NEED SSL/TLS:-
When you open a website and send data (password, OTP, card details)...
  1.Without SSL/TLS ===>>> data travels plain text, hackers can read it.
  2.With SSL/TLS ======>>> data becomes encrypted, no one can read it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW SSL/TLS WORKS:-

Symmetric:-
  1.faster and more efficient, suitable for large data.
  2.challenging key distribution, single key must be kept secret.

Asymmetric:-
  1.slower, suitable for small data.
  2.simplified key distribution, secure even if the public key is sharing.
  3.two keys: 1.public-key
            2.private-key

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS SSL-CERTIFICATE:-
 An SSL certificate is a digital ID card of a website.

It contains:
  1.Website name (domain)
  2.Owner details
  3.Public Key
  4.Validity (expiry date)
  5.Digital Signature from CA (Certificate Authority)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WORKING OF SSL-TLS:-
1.TCP handshake
2.certficate checking
3.key exchange
4.data exchange

1.Client Hello (Browser → Server)
  Your browser says:
  "Hello server, I support these TLS versions and ciphers. Let's start secure connection!"

2.Server Hello (Server → Browser)
  Server replies:
  "Hello! I choose this TLS version and cipher."

3.Server Sends SSL Certificate
  The server sends its certificate + public key.

4.Browser Verifies Certificate
  Browser checks:
  Was certificate signed by a trusted CA?
  Is the certificate expired?
  Is this certificate really for this website?
  If everything is OK → Lock icon appears 🔒

5.Key Exchange (Very Important)
  Browser creates a pre-master secret (random string) and:
  ✔️ Encrypts it with Server’s Public Key
  ✔️ Sends it to the server
  Only the server can decrypt it using its Private Key.
  Now both browser and server have the same secret.

6.Session Key Generation (Symmetric Key)
  Using the pre-master secret: 
  ✔️ Both sides generate same symmetric key 
  ✔️ This key is used for all further data communication
  Symmetric is fast → perfect for actual data.

7.Encrypted Data Exchange (Real Communication)
  Now everything you send:
  Passwords
  OTP
  Messages
  Payments
  → are encrypted with symmetric key → super fast and secure.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SIMPLY SAY...

When you open an HTTPS website:
Browser and server say "hello".
Server shows certificate.
Browser verifies it.
Browser creates a secret key.
Secret key is sent encrypted using asymmetric encryption.
Both sides generate a symmetric key.
All data now uses fast symmetric encryption.
✔️ Data is secure
✔️ Hackers cannot read it
✔️ Website is trusted
✔️ You see the lock 🔒

“TLS uses asymmetric encryption for key exchange and symmetric encryption for data exchange.”
“HTTPS is just HTTP running inside a TLS-secured tunnel.”

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHY HASHING IS USED IN PASSWORDS:-

We don’t store passwords.
We store hash of the password.

Example:
User password: Mayur@123
Stored hash: 8f5b0af9d...

If a hacker steals the database → they still cannot see the real password.
